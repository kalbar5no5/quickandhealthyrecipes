Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
