How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
