Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
