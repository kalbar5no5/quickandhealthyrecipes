How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
