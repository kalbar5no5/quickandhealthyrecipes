Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
