Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
