Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
