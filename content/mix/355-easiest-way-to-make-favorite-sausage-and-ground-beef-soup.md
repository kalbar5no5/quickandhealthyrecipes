Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
