Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
