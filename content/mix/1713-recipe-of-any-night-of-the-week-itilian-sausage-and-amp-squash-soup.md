Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
