Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
