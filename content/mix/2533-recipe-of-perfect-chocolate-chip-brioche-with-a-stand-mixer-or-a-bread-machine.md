Making brioche provides the baker with the thrill of working with a leavened dough, and as the golden brown, domed buns come out of the oven, the buttery and yeasty smell is. Be careful if your bread maker&#39;s &#34;add fruits and nuts&#34; beep rings early! Mine does and thus the machine was too hot and melted all the chocolate chips. A big high loaf with a soft cake-like texture it&#39;s great for dessert or peanut butter sandwiches. I also added a few drops of vanilla extract increased. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
