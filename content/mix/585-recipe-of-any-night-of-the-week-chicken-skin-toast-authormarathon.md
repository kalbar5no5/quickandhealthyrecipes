Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
