Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
