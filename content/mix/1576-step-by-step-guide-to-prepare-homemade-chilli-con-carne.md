Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
