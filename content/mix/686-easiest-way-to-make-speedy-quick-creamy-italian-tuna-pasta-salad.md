How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
