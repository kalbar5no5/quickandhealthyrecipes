Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
