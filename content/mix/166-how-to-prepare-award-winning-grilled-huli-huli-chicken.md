Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
