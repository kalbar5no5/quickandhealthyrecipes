Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
