Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
