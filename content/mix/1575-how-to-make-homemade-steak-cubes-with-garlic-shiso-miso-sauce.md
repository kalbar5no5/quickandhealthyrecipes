recipeingredient:
- "220 to 230 grams Pork chicken beef etc meat thats cut thickly  I used pork roast this time"
- "2 tsp Katakuriko potato starch flour"
- "2 tsp Miso"
- "2 tsp Mirin"
- "1 tsp Cooking sake"
- "1/2 to 1 teaspoon Sugar"
- "1/2 tsp Soy sauce"
- "3 leaves Shiso leaves"
- "2 to 3 cloves Garlic"
- "1 Salt pepper black pepper"
- "1 Vegetable oil"
- "1 Red chili pepper optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the ◆ ingredients. Grate just 1/2 of a clove of garlic, add to the ◆ ingredients and mix. Take the cores out of the remaining garlic cloves and slice about 1 mm thick."
- "Finely shred the shiso leaves."
- "Cut the meat into easy-to-eat cubes (I used pork roast meat in the photo). Season with salt and pepper, and coat evenly with the katakuriko."
- "Put the sliced garlic and oil in a frying pan and cook until the garlic is fragrant. (If you want the dish to be spicy, add a de-seeded red chili pepper at this time.)"
- "The garlic will burn in no time so keep an eye on it. When it is lightly brown, place the garlic out onto a paper towel. (Leave the oil in the frying pan.)"
- "Pan fry the meat in the same frying pan. Don&#39;t move it around until it has browned. When the first side has browned nicely..."
- "...brown the other side too. If you are using pork or chicken, it should be cooked through to the center, so add 1 tablespoon of sake (not listed in the ingredients), lower the heat, cover with a lid and cook through."
- "Take the lid off. If there&#39;s any moisture left in the pan the flavor will not be as strong and the sauce won&#39;t coat the meat properly, so turn the heat up to evaporate that moisture. Add the ◆ ingredients to the pan and mix quickly. Turn off the heat."
- "Add the shiso leaves, mix them up a little and it&#39;s done. (The shiso leaves will soften in the residual heat.) Arrange on serving plates and sprinkle with black pepper."
- "This sauce transforms even the blandest cuts of chicken into a flavor-packed meal. Here I used 230 g of breast meat after taking the skin off (1 breast)."
- "It&#39;ll turn out to be a really filling and hearty dish, especially if you use nice, thick chunks of meat. The seasoning goes really well with plain rice as well as cold beer. Serve with your favorite vegetables on the side."

Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
