Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
