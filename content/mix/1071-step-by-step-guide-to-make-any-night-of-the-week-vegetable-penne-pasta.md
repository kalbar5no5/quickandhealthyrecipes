Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
