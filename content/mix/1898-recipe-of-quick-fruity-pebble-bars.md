Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
