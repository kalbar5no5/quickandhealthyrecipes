Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
