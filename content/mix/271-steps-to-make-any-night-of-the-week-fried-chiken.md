Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
