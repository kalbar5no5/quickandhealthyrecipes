Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
