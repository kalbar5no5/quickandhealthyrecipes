Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
