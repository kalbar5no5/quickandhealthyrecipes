Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
