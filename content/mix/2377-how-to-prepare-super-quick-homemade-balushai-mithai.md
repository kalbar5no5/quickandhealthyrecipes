Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
