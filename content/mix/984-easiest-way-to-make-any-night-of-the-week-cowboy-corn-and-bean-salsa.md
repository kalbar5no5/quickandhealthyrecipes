Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
