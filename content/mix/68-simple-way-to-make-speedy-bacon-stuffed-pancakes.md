Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
