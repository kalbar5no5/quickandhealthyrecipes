Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
