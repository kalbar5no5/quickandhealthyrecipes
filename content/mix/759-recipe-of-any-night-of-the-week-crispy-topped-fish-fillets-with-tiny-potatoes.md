Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
