Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
