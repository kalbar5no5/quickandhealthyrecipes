How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
