Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
