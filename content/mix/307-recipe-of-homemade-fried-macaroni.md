Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
