Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
