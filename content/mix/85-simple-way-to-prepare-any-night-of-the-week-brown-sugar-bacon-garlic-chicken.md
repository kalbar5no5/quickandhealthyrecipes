Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
