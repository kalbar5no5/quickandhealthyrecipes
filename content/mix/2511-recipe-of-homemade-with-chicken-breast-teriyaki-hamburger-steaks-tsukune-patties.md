Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
