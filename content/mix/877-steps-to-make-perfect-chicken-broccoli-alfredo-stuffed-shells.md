Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
