Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
