Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk.

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels.
