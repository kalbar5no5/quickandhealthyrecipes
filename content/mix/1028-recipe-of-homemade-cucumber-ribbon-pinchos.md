Stir in soy sauce and sesame oil. Using a vegetable peeler or a mandolin, cut the cucumbers lengthwise into thin ribbons. In a large bowl, toss the cucumber ribbons with the sliced radishes, chives, rice wine vinegar and the oil. Using a spiralizer, cut the cucumber into ribbons with the ribbon blade.

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
