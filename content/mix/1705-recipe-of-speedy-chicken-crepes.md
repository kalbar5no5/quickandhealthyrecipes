Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
