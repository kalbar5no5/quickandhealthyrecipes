Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
