recipeingredient:
- " For the sauce"
- "2 Tablespoons butter"
- "2/3 cup basic storebought BBQ sauce Sweet Baby Rays Bulls Eye or Kraft will work just fine"
- "1/3 cup Tabasco sauce if Tabasco is too hot use Franks or Crystal but you might like to add just a little more vinegar"
- " optional up to 1 Tablespoon distilled white vinegar if needed"
- " optional up to 1 Tbsp of a superhot hot sauce to up the heat"
- " optional up to 15 Tablespoons brown sugar if needed white sugar honey maple syrup and agave are also fine"
- " For the chicken"
- "4 pounds chicken drums andor thighs andor whole wings"
- "2.5-3 teaspoons garlic salt"
- "1 mixture of 12 cup flour and 12 cup corn starch"
- " vegetable oil for frying"
recipeinstructions:
- "FOR THE SAUCE (Steps 1 &amp; 2): Put the butter, BBQ sauce and Tabasco in a small sauce pan and bring to a very gentle boil over medium heat for about thirty seconds, stirring to incorporate the melted butter into the sauce."
- "Turn the heat to low and simmer for another minute or two. Taste a little bit of completely cooled sauce (I like to use a plastic spoon because it doesn&#39;t retain or conduct heat) to see if it needs more tang, sweet, or heat, and add any of the optional ingredients as necessary to adjust the flavor to your liking. Give it a stir and let simmer for another minute or so to let all the flavors meld."
- "FOR THE CHICKEN (Steps 3 to 8. Optional baking instead of frying instructions in Step 9): Season your chicken with the salt, giving it a gentle toss/massage to ensure that it&#39;s evenly seasoned. Let it sit on the counter, covered, for about 45 minutes, to let it come up in temperature and to let the seasoning absorb."
- "In whatever vessel you use to deep fry, bring 4 to 5 inches of vegetable oil up to roughly 360F over medium heat. You&#39;ll know it&#39;s ready when you throw a pinch of flour in it and it gently but immediately sizzles and rises."
- "Toss the flour and corn starch mixture into your chicken, coating it thoroughly, but lightly."
- "Fry 4 or 5 pieces of chicken at a time, about 20 minutes total, 10 minutes per side, and set aside on a rack while you finish frying the rest of the chicken. If you find your chicken browning too much too quickly, turn your heat down just a tad."
- "While you&#39;re frying your last batch of chicken, bring your sauce back up to a gentle simmer over medium heat, then keep it warm on the lowest heat setting."
- "Put all your fried chicken in a large mixing bowl, pour the warm sauce over it, and give it a few good gentle tosses (preferably with tongs, a large spoon, or cooking gloved hands to avoid capsaicin on your skin) to thoroughly coat all the chicken."
- "IF YOU PREFER TO BAKE YOUR CHICKEN IN THE OVEN: Preheat the oven to 425F, put it all on a rack over a pan to catch the drippings, and roast on the center rack for 50 minutes before tossing in the sauce."

Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
