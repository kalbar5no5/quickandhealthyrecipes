Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
