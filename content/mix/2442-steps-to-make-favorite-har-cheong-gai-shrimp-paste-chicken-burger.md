I would say that while the outer layer was quite crisp, I wished there was a stronger prawn paste fragrance and succulence within. Seriously, who doesn&#39;t enjoy the occasional meal of deep-fried chicken? In fact, I find it very hard to resist this local dish of fried prawn paste chicken that we call har cheong gai in the Cantonese dialect. With Har Cheong Gai, the batter is added to the marinade right at the beginning and then the chicken is left to marinade overnight. 

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
