How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
