Meats (bacon, ham, sausage) Cheese (pepper jack, cheddar, provolone, swiss) Cookies. Bagels are a versatile base for any breakfast eater — sweet or savory, vegetarian or carnivorous, just a little hungry or ready to visit an all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet, you can prepare a bagel to satisfy any craving. For a lighter option, try mixing up your own cream cheese and adding to your favorite bagel. Over medium heat, fry egg in frying pan. Turn off heat but, leave pan on burner. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
