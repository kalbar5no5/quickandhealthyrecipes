Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
