Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
