Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
