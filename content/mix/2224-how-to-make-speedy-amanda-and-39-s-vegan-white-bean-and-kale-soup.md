Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
