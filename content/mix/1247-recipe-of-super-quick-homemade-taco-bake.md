How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
