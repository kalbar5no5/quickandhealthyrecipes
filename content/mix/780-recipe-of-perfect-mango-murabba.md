Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
