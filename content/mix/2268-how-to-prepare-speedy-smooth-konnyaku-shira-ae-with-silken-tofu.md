Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
