I love Indian food, and this is one of my favorite cuisines in the world. Their food is very flavorful and rich in spices. The masala base for this prawn karhayi is pretty basic. Its a tomato based gravy so it has lots of tomatoes and very little onion, and some yogurt in the end.

The masala base for this prawn karhayi is pretty basic. Its a tomato based gravy so it has lots of tomatoes and very little onion, and some yogurt in the end. Start off by adding ghee or butter in a wok. Add finely chopped garlic, onion and green chilies. Now i made a masala style prawn recipe and it was yummy. 

Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
