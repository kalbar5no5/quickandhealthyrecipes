Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood.

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body.
