Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
