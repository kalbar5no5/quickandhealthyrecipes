Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
