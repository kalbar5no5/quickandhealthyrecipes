Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
