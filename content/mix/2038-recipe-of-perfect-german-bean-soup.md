Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
