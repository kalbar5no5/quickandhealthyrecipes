How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
