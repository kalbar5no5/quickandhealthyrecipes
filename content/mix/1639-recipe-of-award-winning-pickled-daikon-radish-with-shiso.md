Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
