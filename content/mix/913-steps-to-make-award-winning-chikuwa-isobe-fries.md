How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
