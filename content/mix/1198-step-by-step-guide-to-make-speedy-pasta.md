Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
