Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
