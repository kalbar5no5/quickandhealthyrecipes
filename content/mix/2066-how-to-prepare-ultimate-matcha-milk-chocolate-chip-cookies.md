Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
