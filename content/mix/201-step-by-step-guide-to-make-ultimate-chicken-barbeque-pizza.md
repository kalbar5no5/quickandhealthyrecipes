How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
