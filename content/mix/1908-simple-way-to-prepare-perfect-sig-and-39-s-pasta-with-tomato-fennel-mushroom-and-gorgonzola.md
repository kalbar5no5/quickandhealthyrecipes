Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
