Add mashed potatoes, beaten eggs, flour, cheese, and parsley to bowl with leeks, and gently fold together until well blended. You&#39;ll need to cook the potato cakes in batches to avoid crowding the pan. Heat a thin film of oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat. Mashed potato cakes are an easy way to use up leftover mashed potatoes or to add a new twist to your potato side dishes. 

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
