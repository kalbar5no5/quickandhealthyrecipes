Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
