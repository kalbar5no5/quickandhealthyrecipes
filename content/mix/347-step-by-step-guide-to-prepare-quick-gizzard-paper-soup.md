Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
