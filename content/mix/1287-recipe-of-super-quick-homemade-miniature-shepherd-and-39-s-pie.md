Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
