How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
