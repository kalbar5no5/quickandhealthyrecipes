Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
