Let me know in the comments. Kare Kare (pronounced as kah-reh ka-reh) is a Filipino peanut-based stew. It&#39;s thick, rich, and probably one of the most luxurious and hearty Filipino dish you&#39;ll ever eat. A traditional Filipino Kare-Kare is an ox tail &amp; tripe stew with eggplants and green beans in a peanut-based sauce and accompanied by a salty and pungent shrimp paste called, &#39; bagoong alamang.&#39; This is a staple dish in many Filipino households - and I was told to try &#34;Kare-Kare&#34; by several Filipino vegans before my visit in Manila. For those of you who are not familiar with Kare Kare, it is a filipino peanut stew, colored with annatto, thickened with ground rice, flavored with meats and gulay (vegetables), and served with bagoong (shrimp paste) and rice. 

Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
