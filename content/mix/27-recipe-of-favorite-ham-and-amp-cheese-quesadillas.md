Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
