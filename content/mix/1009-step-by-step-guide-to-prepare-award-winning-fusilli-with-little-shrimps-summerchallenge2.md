Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
