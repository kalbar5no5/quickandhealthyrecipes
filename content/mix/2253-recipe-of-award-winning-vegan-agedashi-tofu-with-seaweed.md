recipeingredient:
- "1 block Soft or silken tofu"
- "5 tablespoons Potato starch"
- "1 splash oil for frying"
- "5 tablespoons Soy or ponzu lime yuzu lemon or lemon verbena"
- " Vegan dashi kombu seaweed and shittake"
- "1 sprinkle of Nori Seawwed"
- "1 sprinkle of Aomori seaweed"
- " Spring onions just the greens"
- " Grated radish andor ginger"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the vegan dashi stock in advance. You will need to lightly simmer 1 shiitake and 1 inch piece of kombu per cup of water. A long and gentle simmer is best but if you are short of time you can make in half an hour. Cool until ready to use. Vegan dashi can be used in lots of recipes and adds umami ðŸ˜‹"
- "Gently drain the tofu and place on kitchen paper. You canâ€™t press in the same way as you would a firmed tofu as itâ€™s really delicate. Cut into cubes."
- "Prepare the sauce by using a little dashi stock and simmering in a pan with soy sauce or ponzu and a few pinches of sugar. The sauce will thicken slightly but donâ€™t overcook. I seasoned mine with some lemon verbena from the garden. It should be served warm and the cubes will sit in the sauce."
- "Dip each side of the tofu square into the potato flour. Heat a little oil and gently fry on each side. It should colour but not brown."
- "Sprinkle with your choice of toppings (you only need a tiny bit). This time I used nori and aonori seaweed, spring onion, ginger and grated pinch radish. I also like grated white radish (mooli)."

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
