Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
