Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
