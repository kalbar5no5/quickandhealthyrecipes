Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
