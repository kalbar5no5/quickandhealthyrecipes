Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
