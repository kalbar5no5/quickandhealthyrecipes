Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
