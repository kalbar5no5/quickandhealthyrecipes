Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
