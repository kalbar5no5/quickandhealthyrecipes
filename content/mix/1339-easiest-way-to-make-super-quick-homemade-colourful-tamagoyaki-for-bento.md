Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
