Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
