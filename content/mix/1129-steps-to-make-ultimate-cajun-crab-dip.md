Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
