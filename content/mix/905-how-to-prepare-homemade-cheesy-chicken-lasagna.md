Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
