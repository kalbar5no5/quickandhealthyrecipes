Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
