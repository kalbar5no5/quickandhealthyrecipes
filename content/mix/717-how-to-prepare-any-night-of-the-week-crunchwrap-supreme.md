I have completely forgotten how delicious the occasional Crunch Wrap Supreme was!!!! There is a bit of a problem getting all the ingredients-I will have to rely on friends, once worldwide travel begins again-to bring the taco seasonings.

Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
