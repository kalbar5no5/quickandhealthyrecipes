Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
