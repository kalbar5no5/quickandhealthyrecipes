Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
