Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
