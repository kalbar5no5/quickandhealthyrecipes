Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
