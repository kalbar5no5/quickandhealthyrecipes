Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
