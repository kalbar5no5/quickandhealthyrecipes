Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
