Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
