Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood.

Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
