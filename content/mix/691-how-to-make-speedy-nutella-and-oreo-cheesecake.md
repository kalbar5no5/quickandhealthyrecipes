Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
