Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
