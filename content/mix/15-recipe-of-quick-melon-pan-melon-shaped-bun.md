- "Dip the ball into a bowl of granulated sugar (2 tbsp) to coat the cookie dough. Then use a dough scraper or knife to gently score criss-cross or any pattern onto the cookie."

Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
