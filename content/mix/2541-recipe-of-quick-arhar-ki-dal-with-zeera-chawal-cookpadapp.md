Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
