Mix the meats, panko, egg, garlic, onion, paprika, salt and pepper in a large bowl with your hands until completely combined. Use a cookie scoop to shape into meatballs.

Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
