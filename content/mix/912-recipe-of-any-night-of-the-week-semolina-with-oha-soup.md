Just give this recipe a try and you are on. I relied on Julia Child&#39;s basic meat stock recipe using beef marrow bones and a couple vegetables and herbs, and an afternoon at home with a bottle of decongestants to get it done, and ended up reducing it by one-fourth at the end, just to get a pronounced flavor. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
