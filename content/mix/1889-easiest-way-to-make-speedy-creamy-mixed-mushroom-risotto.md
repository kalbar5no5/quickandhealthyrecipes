Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
