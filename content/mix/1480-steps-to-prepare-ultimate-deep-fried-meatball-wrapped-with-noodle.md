Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
