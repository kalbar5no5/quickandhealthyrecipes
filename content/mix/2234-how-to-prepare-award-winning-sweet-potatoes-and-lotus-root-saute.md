How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
