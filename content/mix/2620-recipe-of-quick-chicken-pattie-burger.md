Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
