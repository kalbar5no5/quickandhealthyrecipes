Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
