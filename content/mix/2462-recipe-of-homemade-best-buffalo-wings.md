Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
