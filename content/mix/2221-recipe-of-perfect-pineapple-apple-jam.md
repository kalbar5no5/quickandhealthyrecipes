Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
