Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
