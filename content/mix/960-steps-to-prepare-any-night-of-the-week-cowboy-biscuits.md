Since there were no ovens available on the open range, cowboys baked their biscuits in cast iron skillets or Dutch ovens, over hot coals. The Ingredients in Cowboy Biscuits There are only three ingredients in traditional cowboy biscuits: sourdough starter, flour, and salt. I love bread so when I get a hold of a bread recipe, I lock it up tight. 

How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
