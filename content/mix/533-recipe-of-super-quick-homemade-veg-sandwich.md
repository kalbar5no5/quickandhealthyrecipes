Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
