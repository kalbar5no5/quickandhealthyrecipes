Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
