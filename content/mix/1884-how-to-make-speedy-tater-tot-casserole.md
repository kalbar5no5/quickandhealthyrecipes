Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
