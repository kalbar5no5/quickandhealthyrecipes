Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
