Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become better. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
