Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
