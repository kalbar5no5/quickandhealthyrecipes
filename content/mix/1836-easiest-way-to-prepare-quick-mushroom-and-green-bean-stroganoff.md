Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
