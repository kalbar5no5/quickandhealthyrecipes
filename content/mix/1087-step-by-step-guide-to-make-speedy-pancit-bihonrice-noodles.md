Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
