Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
