Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
