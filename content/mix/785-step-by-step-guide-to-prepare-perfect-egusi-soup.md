Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
