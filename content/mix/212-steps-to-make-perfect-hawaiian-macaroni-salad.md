How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
