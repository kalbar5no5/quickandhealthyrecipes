Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
