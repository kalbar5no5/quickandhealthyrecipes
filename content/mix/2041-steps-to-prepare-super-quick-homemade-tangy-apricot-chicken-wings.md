Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
