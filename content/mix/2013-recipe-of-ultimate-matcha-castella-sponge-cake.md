Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
