Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
