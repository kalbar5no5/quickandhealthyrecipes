Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
