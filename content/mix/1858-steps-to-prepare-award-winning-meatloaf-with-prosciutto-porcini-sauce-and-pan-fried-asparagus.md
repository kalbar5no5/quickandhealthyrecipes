Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
