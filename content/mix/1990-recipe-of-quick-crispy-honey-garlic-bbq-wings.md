Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
