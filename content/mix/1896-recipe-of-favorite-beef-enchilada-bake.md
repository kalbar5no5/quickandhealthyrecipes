Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them.
