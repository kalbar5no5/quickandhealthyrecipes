Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
