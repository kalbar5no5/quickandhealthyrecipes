Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
