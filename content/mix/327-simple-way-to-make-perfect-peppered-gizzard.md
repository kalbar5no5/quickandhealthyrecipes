Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
