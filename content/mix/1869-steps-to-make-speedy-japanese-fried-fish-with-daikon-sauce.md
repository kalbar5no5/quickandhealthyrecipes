Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
