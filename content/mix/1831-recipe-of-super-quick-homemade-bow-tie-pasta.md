Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
