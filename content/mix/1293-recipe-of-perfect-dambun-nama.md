Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
