Hey everyone, it is me, Dave, welcome to my recipe site. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, pepper chiken. It is one of my favorites. This time, I will make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

The lemon-pepper + chicken combo is beloved for a number of reasons, most of which can be summed up this way: Lemon-pepper is a simple, low-cost way to dress up an otherwise bland piece of chicken. The zesty lemon flavor mingles beautifully with spicy black pepper to create a refreshing flavor combination that&#39;s bright but not too overwhelming. South Indian pepper chicken is a delicious, aromatic, hot &amp; spicy side dish to serve with rice or chapati. This is great to enjoy during monsoon or winters.

Pepper chiken is one of the most favored of current trending meals on earth. It is appreciated by millions daily. It's simple, it's quick, it tastes yummy. Pepper chiken is something that I have loved my entire life. They are fine and they look wonderful.


To get started with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can have pepper chiken using 11 ingredients and 2 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Pepper chiken:

1. Prepare  Kaza
1. Take  Albasa
1. Make ready  Attarugu
1. Get 2 Tomato
1. Get  Maggi
1. Prepare  Chiken spices
1. Make ready  Carrot
1. Make ready  Green pepper
1. Make ready  Oil
1. Prepare  Citta
1. Take  Tafarnuwa


Saute/sear until all sides of chicken have a golden brown &#34;crust&#34;. In Black Pepper Chicken, chicken is not deep fried rather marinated and pouched which is called &#34;silken-ed&#34; in Asian cuisine. It takes almost same time as battered and fried chicken (staple Chinese take-out cooking technique) but chicken comes out super moist. almost soft like silk. I think that&#39;s why the name.

It takes almost same time as battered and fried chicken (staple Chinese take-out cooking technique) but chicken comes out super moist. almost soft like silk. I think that&#39;s why the name. Mix flour and Lemon &amp; Pepper Seasoning in shallow dish. Melt butter in large nonstick skillet on medium heat. In a small bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
