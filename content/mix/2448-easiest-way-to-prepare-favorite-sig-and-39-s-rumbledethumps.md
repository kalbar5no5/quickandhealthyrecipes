How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
