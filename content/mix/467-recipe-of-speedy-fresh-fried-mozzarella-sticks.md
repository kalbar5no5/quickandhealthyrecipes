Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
