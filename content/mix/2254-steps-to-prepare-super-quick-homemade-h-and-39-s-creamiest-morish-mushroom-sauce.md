Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
