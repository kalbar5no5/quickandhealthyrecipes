Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
