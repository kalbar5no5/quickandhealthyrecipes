Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
