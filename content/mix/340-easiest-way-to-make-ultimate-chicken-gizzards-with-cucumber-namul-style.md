Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
