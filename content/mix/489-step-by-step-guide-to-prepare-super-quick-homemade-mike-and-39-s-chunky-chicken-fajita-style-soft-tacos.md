Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
