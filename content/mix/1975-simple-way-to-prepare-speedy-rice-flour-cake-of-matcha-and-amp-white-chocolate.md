Add the wet ingredients into the mixture and use the fork to mix until well combined, making sure the flour from bottom and sides are well incorporated too.

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
