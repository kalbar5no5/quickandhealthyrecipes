Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
