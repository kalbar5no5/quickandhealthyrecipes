How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
