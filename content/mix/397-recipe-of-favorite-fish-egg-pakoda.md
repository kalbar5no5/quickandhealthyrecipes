Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
