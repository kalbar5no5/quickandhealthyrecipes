Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
