Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
