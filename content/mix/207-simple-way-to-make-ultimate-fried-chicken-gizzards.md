How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
