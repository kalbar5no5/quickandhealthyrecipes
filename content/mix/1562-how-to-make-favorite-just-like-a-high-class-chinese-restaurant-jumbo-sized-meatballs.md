Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
