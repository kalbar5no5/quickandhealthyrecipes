Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine.
