Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
