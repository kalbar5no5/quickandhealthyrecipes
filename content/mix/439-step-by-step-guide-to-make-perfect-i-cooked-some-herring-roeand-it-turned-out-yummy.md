Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
