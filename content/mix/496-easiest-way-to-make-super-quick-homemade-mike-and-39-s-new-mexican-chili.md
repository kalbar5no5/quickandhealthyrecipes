Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
