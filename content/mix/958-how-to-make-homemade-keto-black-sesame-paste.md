Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
