How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
