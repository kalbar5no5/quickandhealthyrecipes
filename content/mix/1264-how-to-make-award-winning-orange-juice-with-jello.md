How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
