Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
