Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
