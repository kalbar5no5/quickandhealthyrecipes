Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
