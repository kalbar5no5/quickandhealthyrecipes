Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine.
