Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
