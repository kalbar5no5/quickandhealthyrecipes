Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
