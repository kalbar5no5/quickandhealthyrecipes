Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
