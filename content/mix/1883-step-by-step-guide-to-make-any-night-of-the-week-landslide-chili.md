Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
