Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
