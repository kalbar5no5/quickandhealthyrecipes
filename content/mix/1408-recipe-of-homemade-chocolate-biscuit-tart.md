Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
