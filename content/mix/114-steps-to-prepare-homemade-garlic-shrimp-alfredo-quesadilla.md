Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
