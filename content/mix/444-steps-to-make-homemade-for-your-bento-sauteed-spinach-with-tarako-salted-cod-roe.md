Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
