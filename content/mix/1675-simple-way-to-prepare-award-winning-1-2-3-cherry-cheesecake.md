Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
