Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
