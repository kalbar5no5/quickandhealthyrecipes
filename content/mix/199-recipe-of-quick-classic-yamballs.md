How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
