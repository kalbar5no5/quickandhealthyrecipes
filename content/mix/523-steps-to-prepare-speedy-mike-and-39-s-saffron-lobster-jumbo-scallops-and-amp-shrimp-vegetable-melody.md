Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
