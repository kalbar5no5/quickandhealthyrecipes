Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
