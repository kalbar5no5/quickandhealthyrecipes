Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
