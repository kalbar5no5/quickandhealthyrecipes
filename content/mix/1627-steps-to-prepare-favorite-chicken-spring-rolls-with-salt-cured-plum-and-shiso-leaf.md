- "6 to 7 Chicken tenders"
- "2 tbsp Umeboshi paste"
- "10 Shiso leaves"
- "10 Spring roll wrappers"
- "200 ml Frying oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place the chicken tenders on a heat-resistant plate, top with Japanese leek, ginger, salt, and pepper, then sprinkle on sake, wrap in plastic wrap, then microwave. See Helpful Hints."
- "Microwave for 2 minutes, turn over the tenders, then microwave for 1 more minute. Without removing the plastic wrap, allow the chicken to cook through with the residual heat. Once cool to the touch, shred each piece into 4 to 6 pieces."
- "Remove the seed from the umeboshi, then mince until it turns into a paste. (Or, you could use the tubed type from the store.)"
- "Spread out the spring roll wrapper, place a shiso leaf on top, spread on the umeboshi paste from Step 3, then top with the shredded chicken tenders."
- "As shown in the photo in Step 4, fold up the corner facing you, then fold the right and left sides over the top, and roll the rest toward the remaining corner. To seal, put a dab of katakuriko dissolved in water (not listed) on the corner (there should be instructions on how to wrap the rolls on the packaging)."
- "Fill a frying pan up to about 2 cm with oil (not listed), then deep fry the spring rolls until golden brown over medium-strong heat. Since the chicken tenders are precooked, the rolls are ready as soon as the wrapper becomes crisp."

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
