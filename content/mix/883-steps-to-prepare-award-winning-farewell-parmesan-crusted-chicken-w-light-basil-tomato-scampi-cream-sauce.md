Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
