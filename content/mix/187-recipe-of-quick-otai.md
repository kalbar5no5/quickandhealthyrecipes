Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
