Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
