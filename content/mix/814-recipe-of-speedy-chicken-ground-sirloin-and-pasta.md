Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
