Chikuwa and mayo are a classic combo, so I decided to add some miso into the mix and place it all on toast. The caramelizing of the miso-mayo on toast is an umami explosion and sprinkling some ao nori after toasting gives this quick snack yet another dimension. Toss with the sakura-ebi and curry powder. Cooking the onion will take soften the flavor, so it will be easier to eat.

Great recipe for For Bentos - Chikuwa Bûche de Noël. I thought of this because I wanted to make a Christmas-themed side dish. Use any type of cheese you like. For younger kids, I recommend just rolling up the sliced cheese and cheddar cheese and decorating with a bento pick. Use any type of cheese you like. 

Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
