Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
