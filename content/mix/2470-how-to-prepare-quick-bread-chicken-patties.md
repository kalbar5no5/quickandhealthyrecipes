Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
