Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
