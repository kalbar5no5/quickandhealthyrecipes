Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
