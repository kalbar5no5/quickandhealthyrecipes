Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
