Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
