Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
