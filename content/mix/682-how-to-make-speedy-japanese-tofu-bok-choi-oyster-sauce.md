Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
