I can&#39;t even tell you how often I make Sloppy Joes… they are so easy and quick and always satisfy. I think my hubby and I both agree that it&#39;s time to step it up a notch when it comes these, so your recipe has. These sloppy joes are a take on the traditional sandwich - and have an asian twist! These are made with ground chicken or pork, a bit of soy sauce, hoisin sauce, fresh lime juice and topped with a fresh and crunchy cabbage slaw and broccoli slaw. Despite the name of this iconic retro dish, the secret to a great sloppy joe is a thick, rich, almost dry consistency, which allows the sandwich to be eaten with your hands. 

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
