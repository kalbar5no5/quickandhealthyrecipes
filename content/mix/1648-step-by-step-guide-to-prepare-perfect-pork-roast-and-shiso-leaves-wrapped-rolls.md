Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
