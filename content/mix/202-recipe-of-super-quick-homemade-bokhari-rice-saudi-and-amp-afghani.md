Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
