recipeingredient:
- " For streusel topping"
- "1 cup cereal with flakes if its got dried fruits and nuts even better Granola and muesli work too"
- "1 stick (8 Tablespoons) butter cut into 12 cubes"
- "3/4 cups packed brown sugar light or dark ok"
- "1/2 cup AP flour"
- "1/8-1/2 teaspoon kosher salt depending on how much you like that sweetsalty contrast in your desserts"
- "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon"
- " Berry filling"
- "1.5-2 lbs berries washed and drained Most kinds can be left whole strawberries should be halved quartered depending on size"
- "1.5-2 Tablespoons flour or corn starch"
- "1-3 Tablespoons sugar depending on how tart your berries are and how sweet you want your filling"
- "1 pinch salt"
- "1 Tablespoon water for each 12 pound of berries"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large mixing bowl, throw in all the streusel topping ingredients, making sure to distribute the salt and cinnamon as evenly as you can across the mixture. Leaving the cereal off to one side, use your fingers in a milking motion to incorporate the butter, brown sugar and flour together until you have pea-sized clumps."
- "Add the cereal in and gently massage to evenly incorporate it throughout the butter/sugar/flour paste. Put in a container and refrigerate for at least 20 to 25 minutes to allow the butter to harden again before baking. If you&#39;re going to bake fairly immediately, put the streusel mixture in the freezer for a good 10 to 15 minutes before baking."
- "Preheat the oven to 400F (This usually takes anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the oven)."
- "Prepare the berries by gently tossing them in a large bowl with the flour or corn starch and sugar to evenly distribute the flour and sugar and to coat each berry thoroughly."
- "Pour the berry mixture into a baking dish that is at least large enough in surface area to allow you to spread the berries in a roughly 2-inch layer. Then spoon the appropriate amount of water over the top of the fruit mixture. The reason I suggest the water be added after the fruit is mixed with the flour or starch and sugar is to avoid too much clumping."
- "Top the berries with a roughly 2/3-inch layer of streusel topping and bake for roughly 25 minutes, or until the streusel topping is baked through to a dark golden brown. Not to worry if your baking dish is so large that the berries would spread out more thinly. Just gather them toward the center to make a roughly 2-inch thick mound. It&#39;s called a crumble. How precise could it be, right? :D"
- "Cool for 10 minutes or so and serve a heaping scoopful with a slightly less heaping scoopful of vanilla ice cream or whipped cream on top. Enjoy! :)"
- "P.S. Leftovers go great with your morning yogurt. ;)"

Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
