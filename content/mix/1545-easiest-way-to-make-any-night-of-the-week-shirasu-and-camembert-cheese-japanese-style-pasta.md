Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
