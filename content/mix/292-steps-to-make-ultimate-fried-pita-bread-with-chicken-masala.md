Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
