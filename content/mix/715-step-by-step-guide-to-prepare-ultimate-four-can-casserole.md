Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
