Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
