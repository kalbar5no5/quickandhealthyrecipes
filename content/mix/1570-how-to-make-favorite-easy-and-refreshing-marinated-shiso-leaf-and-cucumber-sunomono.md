How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
