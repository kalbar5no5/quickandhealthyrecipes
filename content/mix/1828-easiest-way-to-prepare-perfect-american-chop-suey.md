How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
