Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
