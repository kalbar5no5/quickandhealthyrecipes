Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
