Semolina is a high-gluten flour made from hard durum wheat. It has a rather coarse texture, yellow color, and is high in gluten protein.

Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
