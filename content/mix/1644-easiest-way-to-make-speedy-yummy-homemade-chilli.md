Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
