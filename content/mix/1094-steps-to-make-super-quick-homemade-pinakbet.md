How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body.
