How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at combating depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
