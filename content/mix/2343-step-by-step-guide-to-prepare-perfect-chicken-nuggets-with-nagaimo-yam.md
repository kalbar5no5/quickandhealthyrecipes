Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
