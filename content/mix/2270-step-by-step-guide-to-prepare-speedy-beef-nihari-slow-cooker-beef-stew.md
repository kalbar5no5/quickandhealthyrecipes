Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
