Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
