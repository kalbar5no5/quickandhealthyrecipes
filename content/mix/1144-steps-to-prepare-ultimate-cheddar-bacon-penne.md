Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood.

Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body.
