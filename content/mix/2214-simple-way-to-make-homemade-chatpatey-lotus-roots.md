Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
