I always prep and cook the chili the night before and then reheat the next day. This is a combination of many different tomato-based chili recipes. One Wendy&#39;s shift manager exposed on Reddit (via SoYummy) the fact that all of the chili meat comes from burgers that have stayed too long on the grill and are now too old, hard, and dried-out to be disguised under any amount of cheese, pickles, ketchup, and other toppings. The leftover meat pucks are cut up, bagged, and frozen to go into a later batch of chili.

The leftover meat pucks are cut up, bagged, and frozen to go into a later batch of chili. Use a mix of dried and fresh chiles. Cook the chili low and slow. And if all else fails, you can always top it with plenty of Cheddar cheese and sour cream. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
