Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
