Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
