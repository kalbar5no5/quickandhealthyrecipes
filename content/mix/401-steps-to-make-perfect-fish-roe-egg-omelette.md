How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
