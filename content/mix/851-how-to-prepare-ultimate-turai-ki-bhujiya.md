Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
