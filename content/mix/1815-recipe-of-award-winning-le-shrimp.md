Season with salt and pepper, then add prepared sauce to shrimp. Garnish with green onions and serve with rice. A brand new and innovative concept by Paradise Group, Le Shrimp Ramen beautifully incorporate Japanese ramen into Chinese La mian culture. Another encouraging note handwritten by the staff of Le Shrimp Ramen for my delivery order ️ I ordered the prawn dumpling thick vermicelli in shrimp broth and chilled silken tofu with century egg as an appetiser. We are huge fans of their rich and flavourful prawn soup that has a hint of smokiness from the charring of vegetables. 

Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
