Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
