At Your Doorstep Faster Than Ever. Gumbo is perhaps the most literal melting pot. Its influences are African (okra), French (roux), Choctaw Indian (fil√© powder), German (sausages), Spanish, Italian, and more. Like almost everything else about gumbo, even its name evades a clear origin story.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can cook cajun gumbo using 16 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

Sprinkle in flour and, using a wire whisk, stir constantly until brown roux is achieved. Do not allow roux to scorch. Allow the butter to heat for a couple minutes, then add the flour to the pot. Bring the water and beef bouillon cubes to a boil in a large Dutch oven or soup pot. Stir until the bouillon cubes dissolve, and whisk the roux mixture into the boiling water. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
