Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!
