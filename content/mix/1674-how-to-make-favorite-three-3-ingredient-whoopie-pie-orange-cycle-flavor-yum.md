Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
