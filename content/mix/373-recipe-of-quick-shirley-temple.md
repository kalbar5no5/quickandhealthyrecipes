Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.
