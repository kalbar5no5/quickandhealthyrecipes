Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
