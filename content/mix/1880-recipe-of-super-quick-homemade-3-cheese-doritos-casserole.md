Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
