How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
