Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
