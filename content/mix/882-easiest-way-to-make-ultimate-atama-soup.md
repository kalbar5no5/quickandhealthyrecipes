Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.
