Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
