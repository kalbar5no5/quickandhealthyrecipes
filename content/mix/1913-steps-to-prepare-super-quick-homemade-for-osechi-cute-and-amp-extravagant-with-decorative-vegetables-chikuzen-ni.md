Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
