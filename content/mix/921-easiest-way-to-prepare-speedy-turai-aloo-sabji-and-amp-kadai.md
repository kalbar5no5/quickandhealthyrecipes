Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
