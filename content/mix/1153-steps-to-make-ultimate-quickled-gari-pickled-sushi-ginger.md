Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
