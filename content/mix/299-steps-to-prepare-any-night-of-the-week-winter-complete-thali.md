Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
