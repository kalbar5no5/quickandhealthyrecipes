How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
