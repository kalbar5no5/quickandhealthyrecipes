Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
