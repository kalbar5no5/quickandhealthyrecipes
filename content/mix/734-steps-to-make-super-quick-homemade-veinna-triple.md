Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
