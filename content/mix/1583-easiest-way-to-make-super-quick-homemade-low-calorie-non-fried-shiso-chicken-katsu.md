Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
