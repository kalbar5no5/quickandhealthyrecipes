Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
