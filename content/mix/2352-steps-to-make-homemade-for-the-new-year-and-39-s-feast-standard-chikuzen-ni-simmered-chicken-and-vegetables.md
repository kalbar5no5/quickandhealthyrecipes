Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
