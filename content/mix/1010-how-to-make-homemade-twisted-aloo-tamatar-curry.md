Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
