Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
