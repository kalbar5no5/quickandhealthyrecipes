Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
