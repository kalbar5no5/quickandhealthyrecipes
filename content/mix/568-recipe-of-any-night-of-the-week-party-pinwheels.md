recipeinstructions:
- "Do a little prep! Drain as much liquid as possible from pimentos, olives and green chiles. We don&#39;t want soggy roll ups! Cut 6 pieces of wax paper, big enough to wrap around roll ups and twist on ends. Set all aside."
- "In a large bowl cream together cream cheese and ranch mix until well incorporated and smooth (no large chunks of cream cheese remain). Gently stir in black olives, chiles and pimentos until well combined."
- "Let&#39;s Roll! Working one at a time lay a tortilla out in front of you on a clean surface. Place one sixth of the cream cheese mixture on the side of tortilla closest to you.

Leave about 1/4&#34; bare for any overflow while rolling."
- "Beginning near you roll edge of tortilla over itself, then continue to roll away from you ensuring tortilla is tightly rolled without squeezing any filling out the sides. Once rolled, wrap in prepped parchment or waxed paper, twisting ends to seal and set aside on platter. Repeat with remaining tortillas and mixture. When all are done place in fridge for at least 2 - 3 hours, up to overnight, to firm up and allow flavors to blend."
- "To serve, working one at a time again, unwrap each rollup cut off &#34;ugly ends&#34;, (about 1/4&#34;of each side. Just save those as the chef&#39;s treat lol), then cut into 1/2&#34; - 3/4&#34; wide slices. Arrange slices on serving platter cut side up, stacking if necessary is ok, Set &#39;em out and watch &#39;em disappear!"

Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
