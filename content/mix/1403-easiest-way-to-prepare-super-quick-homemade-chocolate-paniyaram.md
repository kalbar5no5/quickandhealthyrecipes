Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
