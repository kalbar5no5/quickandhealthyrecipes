Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
