Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
