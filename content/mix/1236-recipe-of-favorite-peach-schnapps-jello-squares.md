Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
