Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
