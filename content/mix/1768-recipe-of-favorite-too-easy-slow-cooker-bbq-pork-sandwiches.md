Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
