Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
