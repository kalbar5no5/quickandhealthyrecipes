Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
