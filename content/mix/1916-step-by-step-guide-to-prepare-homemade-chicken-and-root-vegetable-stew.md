The root vegetables such as burdock, lotus, carrot and sato-imo (taro) are cooked with konnyaku (yam jelly), dry shiitake, and chicken in dashi, and seasoned with soy sauce and black sugar. A parsnip is a root vegetable similar to the carrot, but has a creamy white hue instead of the familiar orange tint.

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
