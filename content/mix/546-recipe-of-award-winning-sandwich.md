Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
