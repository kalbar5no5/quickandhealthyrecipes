Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
