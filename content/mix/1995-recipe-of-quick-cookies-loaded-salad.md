Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
