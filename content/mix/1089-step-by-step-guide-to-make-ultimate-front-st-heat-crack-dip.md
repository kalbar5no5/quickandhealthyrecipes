Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
