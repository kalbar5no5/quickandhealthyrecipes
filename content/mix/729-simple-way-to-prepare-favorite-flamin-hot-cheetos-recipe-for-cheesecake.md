Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
