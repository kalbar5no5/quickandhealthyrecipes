Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
