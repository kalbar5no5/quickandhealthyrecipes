When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins.

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest.
