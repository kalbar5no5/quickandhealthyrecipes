Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
