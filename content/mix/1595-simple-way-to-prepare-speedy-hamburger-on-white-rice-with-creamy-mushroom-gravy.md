Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
