Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
