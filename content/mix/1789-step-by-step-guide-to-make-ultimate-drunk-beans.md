Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
