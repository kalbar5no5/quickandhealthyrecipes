Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at battling depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
