Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
