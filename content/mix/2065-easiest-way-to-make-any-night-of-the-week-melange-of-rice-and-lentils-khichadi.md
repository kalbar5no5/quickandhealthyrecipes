Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
