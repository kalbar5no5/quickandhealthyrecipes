Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
