A quick and easy penne pasta salad with broccoli, red pepper and marinated artichoke hearts. Sometimes I use feta cheese instead of Parmesan. Mediterranean flavors of roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, capers and feta cheese mix with a hint of cream to make a light sauce in this easy pasta. It&#39;s been a year since I wrote up the recipe so I don&#39;t exactly recall the original recipe I found on their site. While pasta is cooking, prepare the rest of the salad. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
