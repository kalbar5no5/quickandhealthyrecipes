Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at combating depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
