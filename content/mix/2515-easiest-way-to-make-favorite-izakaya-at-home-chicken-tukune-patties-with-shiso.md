Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
