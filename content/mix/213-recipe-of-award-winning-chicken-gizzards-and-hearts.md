Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
