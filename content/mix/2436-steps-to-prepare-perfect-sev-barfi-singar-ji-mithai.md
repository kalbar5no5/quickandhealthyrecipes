Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
