Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
