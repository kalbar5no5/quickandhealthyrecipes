Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
