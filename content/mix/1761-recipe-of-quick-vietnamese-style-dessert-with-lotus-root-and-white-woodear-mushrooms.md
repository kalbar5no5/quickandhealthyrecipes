Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
