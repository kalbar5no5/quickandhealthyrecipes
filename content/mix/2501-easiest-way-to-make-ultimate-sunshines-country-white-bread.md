Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
