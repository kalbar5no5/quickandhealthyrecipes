Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
