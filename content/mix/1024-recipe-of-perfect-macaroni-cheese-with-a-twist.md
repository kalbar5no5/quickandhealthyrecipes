Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
