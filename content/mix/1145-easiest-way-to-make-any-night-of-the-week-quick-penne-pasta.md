Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
