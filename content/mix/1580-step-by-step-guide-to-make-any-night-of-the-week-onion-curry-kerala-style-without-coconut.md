Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
