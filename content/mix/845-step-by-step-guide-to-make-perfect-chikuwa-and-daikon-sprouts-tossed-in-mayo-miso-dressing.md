Daikon Salad is a popular Japanese salad menu at traditional Japanese restaurants and Izakaya, and I hope you enjoy making this easy salad at home. Daikon is mild flavored, very large, white Japanese radish, and it&#39;s often used as garnishing for sashimi or grated and served with Agedashi Tofu or Tempura.

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
