Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
