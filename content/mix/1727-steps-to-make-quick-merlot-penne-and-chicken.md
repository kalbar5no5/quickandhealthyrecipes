Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
