I love Indian food, and this is one of my favorite cuisines in the world. Their food is very flavorful and rich in spices. The masala base for this prawn karhayi is pretty basic. Its a tomato based gravy so it has lots of tomatoes and very little onion, and some yogurt in the end.

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
