Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
