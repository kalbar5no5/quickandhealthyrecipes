Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
