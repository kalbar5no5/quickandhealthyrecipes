Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
