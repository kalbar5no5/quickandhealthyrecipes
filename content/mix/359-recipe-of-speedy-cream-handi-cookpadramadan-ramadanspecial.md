Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
