Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
