How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
