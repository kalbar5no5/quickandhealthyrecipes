Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
