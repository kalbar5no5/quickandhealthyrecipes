Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
