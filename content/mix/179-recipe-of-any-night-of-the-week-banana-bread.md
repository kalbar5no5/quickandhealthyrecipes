Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
