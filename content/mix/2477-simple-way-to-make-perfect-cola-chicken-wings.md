How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
