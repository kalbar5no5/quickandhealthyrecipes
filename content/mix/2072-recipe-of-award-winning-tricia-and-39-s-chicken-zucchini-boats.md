So, when you are spooning it into the zuke boats it&#39;s mostly chicken while the cheese falls to the bottom of the bowl. I&#39;m thinking if you added the soup to the chicken/cheese mixture and then added it to the boats it would work a lot better without the chicken getting dried out. 

Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
