Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
