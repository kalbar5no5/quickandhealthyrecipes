Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
