Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
