- "2 grams Salt"
- "5 grams Raw cane sugar"
- "5 grams Olive oil"
- "150 ml Water"
- "3 grams Instant Dry Yeast"
- "10 grams Butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the ★ ingredients in a bread machine in the order listed. Use the &#34;dough only&#34; program up to the end of the 1st rising."
- "Take the dough out, divide into 8 portions, and round off each. Cover with a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel, and leave to rest for 10 minutes."
- "Deflate the dough lightly, round off each piece again and line them up on a baking sheet. Cover with a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel and leave to rise again (2nd rising), until they are 1.5 to 2 times their original size."
- "Preheat the oven to 250°C. Dust the rolls with bread flour (not listed in the ingredient list) using a tea strainer."
- "Use a moistened, very sharp knife held at an angle to make a slash in the middle of each roll, drawing the blade towards you. Don&#39;t make the cut too deep."
- "Put some room temperature butter in a plastic bag, cut off a corner and squeeze some butter in the slashes on the rolls."
- "This butter is salted. Since the dough itself has very little salt, salted butter used here makes it taste just about right. Do Step 6 rapidly."
- "When the oven has heated up all the way, mist the rolls generously. Turn the oven temperature down to 210°C and bake the rolls for 20 minutes."
- "Cool the baked rolls on a cooling rack."
- "The outside is thin and crispy, and the slashes have opened up very nicely! This are smart looking rolls!"
- "If you slice through one with a bread knife, the crumb is so soft and light! It&#39;s easy for children to eat, and the more you chew on it the more flavorful it gets. It&#39;s ideal as a dinner roll!"
- "They get a bit wrinkly when cold, so mist them lightly and warm them up in a toaster oven to revive the crispy crust!"

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
