Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
