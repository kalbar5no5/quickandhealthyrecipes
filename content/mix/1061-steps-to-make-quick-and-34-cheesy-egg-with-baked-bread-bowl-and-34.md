Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
