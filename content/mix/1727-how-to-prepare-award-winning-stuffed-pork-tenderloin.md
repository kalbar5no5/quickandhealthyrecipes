Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
