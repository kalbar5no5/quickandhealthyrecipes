Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
