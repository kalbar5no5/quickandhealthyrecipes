Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
