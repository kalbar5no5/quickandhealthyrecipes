How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
