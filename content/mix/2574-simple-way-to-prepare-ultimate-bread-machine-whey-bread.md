Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
