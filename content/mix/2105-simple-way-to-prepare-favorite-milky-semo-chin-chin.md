Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!
