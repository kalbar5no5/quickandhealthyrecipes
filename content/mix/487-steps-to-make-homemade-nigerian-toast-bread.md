HEY GUYS, WELCOME BACK TO MY CHANNEL. Butter. generally, people who want to make toast in Nigeria, do it in the oven, or fry the bread. Toast or Nigerian sandwich toast, the make, feel, and taste are distinct from other &#34;bread toasts&#34; in the West, or most bread toast I see here in America. 

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
