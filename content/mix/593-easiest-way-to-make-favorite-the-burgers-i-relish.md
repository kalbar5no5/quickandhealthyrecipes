Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
