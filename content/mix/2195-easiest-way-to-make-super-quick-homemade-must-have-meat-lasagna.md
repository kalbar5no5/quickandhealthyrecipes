Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
