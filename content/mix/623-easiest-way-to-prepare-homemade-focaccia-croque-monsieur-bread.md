- "Bring all 4 corners of the dough together, and pinch to seal the seams."

- "I recommend eating these piping hot fresh out of the oven. I added skim milk powder to the dough to make it more tender, but they&#39;re also good cold."
- "You can warm these up in a toaster oven after they&#39;ve turned cold to revive the soft, fluffy texture."
- "I used this instant bechamel sauce mix that you can make by just adding milk."
- "The dough gets flattened when you make the indentations, so I give this a shorter 2nd rising than for usual bread."

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
