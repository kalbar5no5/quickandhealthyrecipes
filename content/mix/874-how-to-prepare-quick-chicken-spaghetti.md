Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
