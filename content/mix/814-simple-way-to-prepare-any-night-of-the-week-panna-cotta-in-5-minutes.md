Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on.

Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
