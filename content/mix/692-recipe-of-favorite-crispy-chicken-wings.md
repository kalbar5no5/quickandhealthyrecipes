Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
