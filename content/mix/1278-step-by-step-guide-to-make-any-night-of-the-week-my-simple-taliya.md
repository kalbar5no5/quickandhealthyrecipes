Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
