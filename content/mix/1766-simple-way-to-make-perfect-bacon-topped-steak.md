Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
