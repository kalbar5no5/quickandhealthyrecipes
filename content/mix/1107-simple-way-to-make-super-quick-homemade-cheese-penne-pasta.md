Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
