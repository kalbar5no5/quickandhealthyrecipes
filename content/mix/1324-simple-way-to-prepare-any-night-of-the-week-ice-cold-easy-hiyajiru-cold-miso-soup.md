Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
