Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
