Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
