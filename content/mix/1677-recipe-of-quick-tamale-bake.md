Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
