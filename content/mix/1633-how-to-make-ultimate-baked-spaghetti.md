Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
