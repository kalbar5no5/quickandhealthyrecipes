Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
