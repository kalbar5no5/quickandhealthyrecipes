Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
