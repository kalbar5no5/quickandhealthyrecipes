Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
