Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
