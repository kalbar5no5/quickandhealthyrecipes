Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
