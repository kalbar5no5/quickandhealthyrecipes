The main point of this prison-style meatloaf video is to show you what happens when you make I did an Italian meatball-inspired version, which was quite nice, but this method will work with virtually any. Any ground meat can be used to make meatloaf: beef, pork, veal, or lamb. Meatballs: This same recipe can be used to make meatballs instead of a loaf (though I usually leave out the carrots). Wine Note: Anything Italian-style seems like a candidate for Chianti, but with a humble meat loaf like this, I like something more full-bodied.

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
