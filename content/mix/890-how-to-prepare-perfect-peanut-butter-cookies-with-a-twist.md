Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
