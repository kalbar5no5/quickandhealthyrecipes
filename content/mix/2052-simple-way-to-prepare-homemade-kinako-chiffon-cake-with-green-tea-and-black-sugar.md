Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
