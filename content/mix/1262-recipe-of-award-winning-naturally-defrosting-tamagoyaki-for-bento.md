Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
