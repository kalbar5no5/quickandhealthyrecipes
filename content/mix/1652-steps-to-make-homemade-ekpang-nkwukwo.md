Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
