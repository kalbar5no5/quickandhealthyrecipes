The shiso and umeboshi tastes are subtle, if you want a stronger taste, add a little more umeboshi. It&#39;s also really good to serve the shiso leaves on the side and wrap the chicken roll slices in a shiso leaf, then eat. Umeboshi plums are available whole, in a paste form, or as vinegar.

Umeboshi plums are available whole, in a paste form, or as vinegar. For these rolls, I used the paste. Shiso leaves are sometimes referred to as &#34;Japanese basil&#34; but are actually from the beefsteak plant. It tastes nothing like basil, and like ume plums, has an incomparable flavor to any other herb. Make a slit in the chikuwa lengthwise to create an opening. 

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
