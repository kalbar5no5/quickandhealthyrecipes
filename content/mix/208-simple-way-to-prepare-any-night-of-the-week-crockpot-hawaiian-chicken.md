Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
