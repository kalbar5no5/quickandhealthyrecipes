Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
