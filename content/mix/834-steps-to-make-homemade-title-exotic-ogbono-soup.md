Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
