Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
