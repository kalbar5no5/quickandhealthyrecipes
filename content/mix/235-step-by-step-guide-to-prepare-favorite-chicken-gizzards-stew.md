Place gizzards in a colander under cold running water. Wash each gizzard carefully, removing any green spots or other debris. Place gizzards in a large stock pot and cover with an inch or so of water. I keep an eye on them because the booth dries up so you have to keep adding a little more when that happens. After an hour I add some salt, pepper &amp; onion powder. 

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
