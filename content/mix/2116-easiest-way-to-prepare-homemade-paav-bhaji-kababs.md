Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
