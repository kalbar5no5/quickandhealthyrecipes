Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
