Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
