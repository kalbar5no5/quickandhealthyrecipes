How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
