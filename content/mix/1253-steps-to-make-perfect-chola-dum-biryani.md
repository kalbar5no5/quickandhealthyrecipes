Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood.

The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest.
