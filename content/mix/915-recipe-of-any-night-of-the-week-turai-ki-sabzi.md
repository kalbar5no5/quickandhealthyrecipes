Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
