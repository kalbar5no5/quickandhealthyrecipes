Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
