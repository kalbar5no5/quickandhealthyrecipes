Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
