Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
