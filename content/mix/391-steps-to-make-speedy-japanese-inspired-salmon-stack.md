Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
