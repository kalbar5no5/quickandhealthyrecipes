Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
