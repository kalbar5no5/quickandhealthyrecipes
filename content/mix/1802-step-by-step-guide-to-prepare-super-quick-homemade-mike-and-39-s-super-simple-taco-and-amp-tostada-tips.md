Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
