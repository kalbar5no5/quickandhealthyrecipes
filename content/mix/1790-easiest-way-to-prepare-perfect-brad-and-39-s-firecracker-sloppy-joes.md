Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
