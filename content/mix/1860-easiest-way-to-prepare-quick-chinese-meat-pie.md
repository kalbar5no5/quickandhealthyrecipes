Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
