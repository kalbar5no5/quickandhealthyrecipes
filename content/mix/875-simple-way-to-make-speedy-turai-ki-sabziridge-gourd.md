Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
