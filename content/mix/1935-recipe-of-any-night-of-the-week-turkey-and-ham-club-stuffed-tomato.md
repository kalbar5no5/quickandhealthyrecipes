Spread mayonnaise on one side of each bread slice. Stack the following ingredients in order on the first slice of bread, lettuce, tomato, Monterey Jack Cheese, turkey, bacon and a slice of white bread. Repeat above sequence for the second layer. But I figured that a fully-cooked ham only had to get warm, so I could pull it out of the oven as soon as the turkey was done.

Repeat above sequence for the second layer. But I figured that a fully-cooked ham only had to get warm, so I could pull it out of the oven as soon as the turkey was done. I de-boned a turkey, leaving just the leg bones (I removed the thigh bones) and all the wing bones. Lay the ham slices and then the turkey slices over the roll bottoms so all of the bread is covered. Break two of the pieces of bacon in half and lay the bacon pieces on top of the lunchmeat. 

Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
