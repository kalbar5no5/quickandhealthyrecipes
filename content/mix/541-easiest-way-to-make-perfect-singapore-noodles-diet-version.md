Erika was sure she could easily make keto Singapore noodles using shirataki noodles. Singapore Noodles are made with thin rice noodles called vermicelli noodles. They&#39;re very common nowadays, sold at all supermarkets. Wai Wai is my favourite brand - I find that it holds up the best to lots of tossing action - and you&#39;ll find it at Woolies, Coles etc here in Sydney.

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
