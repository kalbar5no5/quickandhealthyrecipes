Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
