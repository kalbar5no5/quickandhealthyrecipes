How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
