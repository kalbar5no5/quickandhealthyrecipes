Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
