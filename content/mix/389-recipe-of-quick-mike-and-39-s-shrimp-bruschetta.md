- "For a Chilled Bruschetta:                                Use pre-steamed shrimp instead of the raw called for in the warmed bruchetta.

How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
