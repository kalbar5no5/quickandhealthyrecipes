Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
