Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
