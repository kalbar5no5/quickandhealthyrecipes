Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
