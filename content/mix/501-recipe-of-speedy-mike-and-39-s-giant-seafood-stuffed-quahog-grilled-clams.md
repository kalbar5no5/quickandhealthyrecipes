Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
