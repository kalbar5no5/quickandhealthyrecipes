Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
