This is the Cantonese spring rolls with a twist of Vietnamese spring rolls. You can make it in advance, and deep-fried directly from the freezer. Originating in southeast Asia, spring rolls are a popular bite of fresh vegetables sliced into matchsticks and wrapped in rice paper. (I love how the wrappers are translucent, so you can take a peek at the colorful flavors inside!) Typically served cold alongside a dipping sauce, they&#39;re crispy, crunchy and delicious. To make the spring rolls: Bring a pot of water to boil and cook the noodles just until al dente, according to package directions.

To make the spring rolls: Bring a pot of water to boil and cook the noodles just until al dente, according to package directions. Drain, rinse them under cool water, and return them to the pot. Off the heat, toss the noodles with the sesame oil and salt, and set aside. Pick up the sides of the spring roll and fold them in over the toppings. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
