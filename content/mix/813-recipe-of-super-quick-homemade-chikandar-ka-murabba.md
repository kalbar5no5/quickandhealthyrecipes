Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
