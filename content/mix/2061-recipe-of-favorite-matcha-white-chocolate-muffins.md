Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
