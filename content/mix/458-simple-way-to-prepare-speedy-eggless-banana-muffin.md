Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
