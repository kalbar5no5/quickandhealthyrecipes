Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine.
