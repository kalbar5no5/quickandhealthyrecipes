Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine.
