Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
