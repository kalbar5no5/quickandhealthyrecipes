Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
