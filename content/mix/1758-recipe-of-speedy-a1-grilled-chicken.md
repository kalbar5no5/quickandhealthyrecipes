Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
