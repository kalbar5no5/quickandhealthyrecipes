Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
