Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
