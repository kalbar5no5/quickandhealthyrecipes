Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
