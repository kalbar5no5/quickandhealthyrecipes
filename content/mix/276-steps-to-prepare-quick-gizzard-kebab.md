Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
