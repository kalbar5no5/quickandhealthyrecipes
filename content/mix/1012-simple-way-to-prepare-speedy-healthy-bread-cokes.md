Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
