Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
