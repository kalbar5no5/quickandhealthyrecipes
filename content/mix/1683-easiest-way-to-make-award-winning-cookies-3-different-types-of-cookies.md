Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
