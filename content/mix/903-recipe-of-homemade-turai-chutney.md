Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
