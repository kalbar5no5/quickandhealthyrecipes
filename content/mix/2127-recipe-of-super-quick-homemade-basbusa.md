Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
