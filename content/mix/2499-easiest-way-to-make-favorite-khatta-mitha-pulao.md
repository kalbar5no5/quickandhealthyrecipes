Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood.

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest.
