Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
