Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
