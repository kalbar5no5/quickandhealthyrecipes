How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
