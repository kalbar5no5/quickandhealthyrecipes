How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
