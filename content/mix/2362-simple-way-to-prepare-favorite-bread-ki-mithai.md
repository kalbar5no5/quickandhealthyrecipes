Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
