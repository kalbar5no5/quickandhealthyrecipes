Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
