recipeinstructions:
- "Be very careful when peeling mangos. They are an extremely slippery fruit and a very sharp knife is required to work with them. Just slice all 4 sides [or cheeks as they&#39;re known] away from the hard seed core. If the mangos are ripe enough, you can simply spoon the meat out of skins. If they&#39;re firm, carefully slice the meat from the skin with your sharp knife. Reserve 1 mango for your salsa finish."

- "Pull veggies off heat when you start to see blistering or charring. Be careful not to seriously burn anything."
- "Wear gloves and chop stems from peppers. Remove seeds and membranes if you want to ease the heat a bit. Add all ingredients except for your reserved mango and pulse in blender until blended with some chunks. Add pineapple juice as well."

- "Lastly, add your remaining mango and rough chop it in your blender on your pulse option. Your guests should be able to see that it&#39;s mango. ☺ Refrigerate for at least 2 hours."
- "This recipe could easily make eight 8 oz jars of salsa. They also make for great gifts! Garnish jars with thin Habenero slices, fresh Cilantro leaves and lime wedges."

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
