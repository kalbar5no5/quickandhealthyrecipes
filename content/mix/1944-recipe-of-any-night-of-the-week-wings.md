Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
