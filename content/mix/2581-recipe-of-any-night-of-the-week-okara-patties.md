Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
