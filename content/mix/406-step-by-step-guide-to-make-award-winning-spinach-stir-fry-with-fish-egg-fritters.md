Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
