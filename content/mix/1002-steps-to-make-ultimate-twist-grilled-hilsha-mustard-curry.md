Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
