Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
