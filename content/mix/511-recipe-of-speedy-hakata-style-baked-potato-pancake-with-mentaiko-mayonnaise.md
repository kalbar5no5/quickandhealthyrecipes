Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
