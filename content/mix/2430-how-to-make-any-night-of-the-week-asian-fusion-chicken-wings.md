Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
