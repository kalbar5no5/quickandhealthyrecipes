A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine.
