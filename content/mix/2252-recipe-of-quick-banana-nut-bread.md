Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
