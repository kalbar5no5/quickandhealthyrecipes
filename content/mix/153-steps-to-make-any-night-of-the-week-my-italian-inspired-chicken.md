I recognize that this dish is so far away from traditional Italian fare. Evenly coat and pack breadcrumbs lightly with your hand While I used chicken drumsticks for my recipe, you can opt for chicken thighs, leg quarters, half chicken, or chopped-up chicken pieces. The recipe works well regardless of the part of the chicken you use. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
