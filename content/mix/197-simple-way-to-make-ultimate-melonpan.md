Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
