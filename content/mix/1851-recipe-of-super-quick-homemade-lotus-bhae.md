Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
