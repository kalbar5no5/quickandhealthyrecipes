Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
