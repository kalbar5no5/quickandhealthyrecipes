How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
