Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
