Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
