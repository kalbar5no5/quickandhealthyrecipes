How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
