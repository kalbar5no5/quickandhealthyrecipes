How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
