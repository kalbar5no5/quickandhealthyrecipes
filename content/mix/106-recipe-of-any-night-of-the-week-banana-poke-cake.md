Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
