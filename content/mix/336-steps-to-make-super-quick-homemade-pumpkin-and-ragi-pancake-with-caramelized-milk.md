Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
