Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
