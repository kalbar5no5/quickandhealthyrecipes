Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
