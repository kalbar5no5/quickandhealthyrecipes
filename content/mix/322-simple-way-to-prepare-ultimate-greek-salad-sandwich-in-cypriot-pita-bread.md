Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
