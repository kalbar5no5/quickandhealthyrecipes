Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
