Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
