Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
