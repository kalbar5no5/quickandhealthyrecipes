Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
