Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
