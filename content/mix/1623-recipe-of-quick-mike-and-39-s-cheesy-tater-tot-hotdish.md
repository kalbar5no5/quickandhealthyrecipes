Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
