Making a chicken biryani in authentic dum style does take some time and needs little expertise. Chicken Biryani is a savory chicken and rice dish that includes layers of chicken, rice, and aromatics that are steamed together. The bottom layer of rice absorbs all the chicken juices as it cooks, giving it a tender texture and rich flavor, while the top layer of rice turns out white and fluffy. Chicken is a good quality protein and when combined with rice, herbs, spices and yogurt, it makes a healthy and filling one pot meal - like every classic chicken dum biryani should be. Just serve it piping hot essentially with a raita and salad or kachumber and wait for all the praises coming your way! 

Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
