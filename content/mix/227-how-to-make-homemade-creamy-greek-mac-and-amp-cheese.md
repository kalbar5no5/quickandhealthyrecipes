How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
