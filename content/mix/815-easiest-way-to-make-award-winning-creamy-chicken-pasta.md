How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
