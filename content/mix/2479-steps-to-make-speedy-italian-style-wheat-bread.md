Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
