Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
