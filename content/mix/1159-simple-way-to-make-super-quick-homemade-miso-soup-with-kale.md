Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
