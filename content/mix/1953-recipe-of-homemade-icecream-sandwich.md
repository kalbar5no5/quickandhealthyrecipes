Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
