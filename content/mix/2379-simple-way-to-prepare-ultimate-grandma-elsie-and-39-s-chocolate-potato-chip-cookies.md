Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
