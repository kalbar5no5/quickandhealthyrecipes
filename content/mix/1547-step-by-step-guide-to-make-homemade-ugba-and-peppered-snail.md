Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
