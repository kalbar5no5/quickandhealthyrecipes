Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
