Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
