Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
