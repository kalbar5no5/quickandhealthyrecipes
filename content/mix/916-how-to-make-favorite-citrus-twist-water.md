Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
