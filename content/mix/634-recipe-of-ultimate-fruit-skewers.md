Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
