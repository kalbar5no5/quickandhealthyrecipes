Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
