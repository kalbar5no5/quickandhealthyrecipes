Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
