Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
