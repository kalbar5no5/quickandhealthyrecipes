Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
