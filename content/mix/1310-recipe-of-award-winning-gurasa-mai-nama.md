How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
