Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
