Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood.

Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.
