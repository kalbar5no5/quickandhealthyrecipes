Both my husband &amp; I really love Lima Beans, &amp; I decided to make some for dinner on Sunday. I thought the Smoked Turkey would add just the right amount of flavor to them &amp; they turned out great. I added a few extra spices to enhance the flavor, &amp; they turned out just wonderful. As a kid in Arkansas we always had sliced tomatoes, onions &amp; cucumbers in vinegar with them with just a hint of sugar.

##### Instructions to make Crockpot beans and smoked turkey:

1. Place everything in your crockpot. Cook on low for 6 hours. Uncover for the last 2 hours, watching that it does dry too much. I usually just leave overnight. Next time I think I&#39;ll add cabbage &amp; chick peas. Serve with white rice, corn bread or baguette.


I added a few extra spices to enhance the flavor, &amp; they turned out just wonderful. As a kid in Arkansas we always had sliced tomatoes, onions &amp; cucumbers in vinegar with them with just a hint of sugar. Add thyme, bay leaves, cayenne, stock, smoked turkey, and beans. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce to a bare simmer. 

Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
