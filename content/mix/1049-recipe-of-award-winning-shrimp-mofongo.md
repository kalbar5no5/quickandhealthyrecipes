Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
