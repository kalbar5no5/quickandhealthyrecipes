Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
