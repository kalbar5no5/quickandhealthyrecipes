Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
