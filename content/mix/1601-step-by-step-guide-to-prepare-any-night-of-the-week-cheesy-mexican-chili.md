Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
