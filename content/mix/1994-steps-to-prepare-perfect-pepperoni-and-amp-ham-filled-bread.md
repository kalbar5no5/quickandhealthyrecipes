Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
