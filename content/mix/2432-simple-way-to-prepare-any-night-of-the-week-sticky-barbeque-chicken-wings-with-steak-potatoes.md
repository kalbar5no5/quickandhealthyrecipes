Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
