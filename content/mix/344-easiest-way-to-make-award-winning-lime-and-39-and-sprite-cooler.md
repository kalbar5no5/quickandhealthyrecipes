Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
