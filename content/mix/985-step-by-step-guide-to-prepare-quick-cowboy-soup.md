Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
