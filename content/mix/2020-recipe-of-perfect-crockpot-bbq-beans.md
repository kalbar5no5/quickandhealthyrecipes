Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
