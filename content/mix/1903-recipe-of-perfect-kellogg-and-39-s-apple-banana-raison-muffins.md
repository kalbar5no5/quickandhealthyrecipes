Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
