Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
