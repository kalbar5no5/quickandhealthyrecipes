Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
