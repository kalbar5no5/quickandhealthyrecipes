recipeingredient:
- "2 eggs worth Your usual tamagoyaki rolled omelette"
- "15 to 20 cm length Plastic wrap"
- "5 Bamboo skewers"
- "2 Rubber bands"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make the plastic wrap, bamboo skewers and rubber bands ready as shown here before making your usual tamagoyaki. (I used a 2-egg tamagoyaki here!)"
- "Put the piping hot tamagoyaki on the edge where you will start rolling. Leave a small gap, then line up the bamboo skewers evenly."
- "Roll the tamagoyaki in the plastic wrap 1-2 times before you get to the skewers. This is important, to prevent the skewers from cutting into the tamagoyaki. (It prevents the tamagoyaki from looking like an amoeba!)"
- "Keep wrapping the tamagoyaki up, keeping the skewers evenly distributed!"
- "The skewers may get shifted around depending on the original shape of the tamagoyaki, so check it from several angles to make sure they are evenly spaced and straight. Adjust them accordingly."
- "When the skewers are positioned correctly, secure both ends of the skewers  with rubber bands. (If you try to put the rubber bands around the skewers only they may slip off, so put them around the ends of the tamagoyaki too.)"
- "When putting on the rubber bands, keep securing it while wrapping the bands around tightly. This way the skewers are less likely to slip!"
- "Leave to cool until just before packing them into a bento box."
- "Take the rubber bands, skewers and plastic wrap off and slice the tamagoyaki. It will look like this."
- "Fall special, for decorating Halloween bentos: Jack o&#39; Lantern version!"
- "Here I separated the yolks from the whites and cooked the yolks first, then cooked the whites. Decorate with black sesame seeds to make them look more flower-like."
- "This version has nori seaweed in it."
- "Here the center is a fish sausage!"
- "The flower shaped tamagoyaki look like this in a bento. These are a bit wobbly."
- "Even if they are wobbly, as long as they look like flowers they&#39;re fine!"
- "This tamoyaki has komatsuna greens in it. I also made fish sausage roses. It&#39;s perfect for small bentos."
- "For bentos for little children, 1-egg tamagoyaki flowers may be just right."
- "About the timing: On the left are flowers from a tamagoyaki that was wrapped after some time (5 minutes after cooking). On the right, flowers from one that was wrapped right after cooking."
- "Results: I think the one wrapped and formed right after cooking looks puffier and nicer. Be careful not to burn yourself!"

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
