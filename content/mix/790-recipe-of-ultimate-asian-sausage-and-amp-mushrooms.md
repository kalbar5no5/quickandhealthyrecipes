Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
