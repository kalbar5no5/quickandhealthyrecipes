How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
