Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.
