Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
