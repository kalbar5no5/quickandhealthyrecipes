Hello everybody, I hope you're having an amazing day today. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, white lotus root cake. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I will make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

If a skewer stuck into the middle comes out clean, it&#39;s done. If you want the cake to have a whiter surface, bake covered with a piece of aluminum foil. Next, boil the lotus seeds over medium heat for another hour. When the lotus seeds are done boiling, drain and grind them into a smooth paste in a blender, adding a little water if necessary.

White Lotus Root Cake is one of the most well liked of recent trending foods on earth. It is enjoyed by millions daily. It's simple, it is quick, it tastes yummy. They are nice and they look wonderful. White Lotus Root Cake is something that I've loved my whole life.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can have white lotus root cake using 6 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

1. Pour the batter into a lined cake pan. In the photo, I used a cake pan made with newspaper. If you&#39;re using a pound cake tin or a milk carton, the ingredient amounts listed above are fine!
1. Bake for about 20 minutes in a preheated 180째C oven. If a skewer stuck into the middle comes out clean, it&#39;s done. If you want the cake to have a whiter surface, bake covered with a piece of aluminum foil.
1. If you&#39;re topping the cake with lotus root chips: microwave thinly sliced lotus root for 25 minutes. If they&#39;re not crispy enough, heat on a grill (or similar).


Add in the flour, eggs, baking powder and vanilla and beat again briefly till combined - try not to overbeat! I suddenly got the idea to make white and black vegetable-based cakes! Black would be burdock root, and white. I decided to try lotus root, keeping to the root vegetable family! Since lotus root becomes sticky and doughy when heated, I thought maybe I can use it instead of eggs. 

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
