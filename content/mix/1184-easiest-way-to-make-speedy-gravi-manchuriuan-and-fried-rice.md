Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
