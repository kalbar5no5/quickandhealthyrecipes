Bengali thali Among all the grand Indian thalis is the comforting Bengali thali, which needn&#39;t always be non-vegetarian, says foodie Purabi Naha. Talking about the niramish (vegetarian) thali, she elaborates, &#34;The Bengali thali is a perfect example of balance of flavours, where we start with the bitter note and end with a sweet one. Its been a year since I shared a North Indian lunch menu here. After I had tried &amp; posted my Punjabi &amp; Gujarati Lunch Thali, I was looking forward to try Rajasthani and Bengali Lunch platters.

Its been a year since I shared a North Indian lunch menu here. After I had tried &amp; posted my Punjabi &amp; Gujarati Lunch Thali, I was looking forward to try Rajasthani and Bengali Lunch platters. Thanks everyone for flooding your ideas. I was standing there, watching the waves dance. Hubby and kiddo were playing hide and seek with the waves. 

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
