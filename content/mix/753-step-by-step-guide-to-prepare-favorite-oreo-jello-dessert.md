Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
