Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body.
