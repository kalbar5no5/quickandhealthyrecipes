Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
