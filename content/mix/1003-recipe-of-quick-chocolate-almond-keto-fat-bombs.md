Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
