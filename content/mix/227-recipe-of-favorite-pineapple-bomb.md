recipeingredient:
- " Sandwich"
- "1 rope smoked sausage"
- "1 thick slice brown sugar ham"
- "1 Hawaiian sweet bread hamburger bun"
- "1-2 slices Swiss cheese"
- "2 pineapple slices"
- "1 Tbs fresh Rosemary leaves"

- " Bomb Spread makes more than enough for 1 sandwich"
- "2 habanero peppers"
- "1/2 cup garlic spread"
- "4 tbs honey approximately"
recipeinstructions:
- "Start with making caramelized onions if you choose to add them. If not cut the rope sausage short enough to fit the bun the slice it open in half vertical down the center."
- "Pour olive oil in warm pan and let it heat up. Once warm fry your ham and sausage in the garlic and rosemary. Season the meats with salt and pepper."
- "While that fries make the &#34;bomb spread&#34;. Start by dicing up both habaneros. Then mix the peppers and honey into the garlic spread. I use a deli bought garlic spread but any garlic spread will work. The important part is making sure the balance is good. Taste the spread as you go and if there is too much heat add more honey to the mix. I don&#39;t actually measure the honey I just add it till the heat is lessened to the point I&#39;m looking for, but judging by eye sight I know there&#39;s at least 2 tbsp."
- "Once the meat is done make the sandwich. It should go, from bottom to top; bottom bun, Swiss cheese slice, ham, sausage slices (I put another slice of swiss on top of the sausage but i like a lot of cheese), fresh pineapple slices (if using caramelized onions add them on top of the pineapple slices), then top bun with the &#34;bomb spread&#34; spread on the inside of the bun generously."
- "Then enjoy. I like to serve mine with mashed yucca. Any left over spread just freeze till next time or for later use on other dishes."

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
