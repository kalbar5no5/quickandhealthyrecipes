Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
