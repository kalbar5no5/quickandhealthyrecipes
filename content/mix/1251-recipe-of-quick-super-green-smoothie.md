Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
