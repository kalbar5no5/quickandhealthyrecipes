Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
