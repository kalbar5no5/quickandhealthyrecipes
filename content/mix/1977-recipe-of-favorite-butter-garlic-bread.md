Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
