Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
