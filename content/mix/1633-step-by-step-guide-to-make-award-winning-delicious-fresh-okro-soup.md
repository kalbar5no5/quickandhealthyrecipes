Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
