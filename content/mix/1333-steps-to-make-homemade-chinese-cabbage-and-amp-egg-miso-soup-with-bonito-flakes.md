Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
