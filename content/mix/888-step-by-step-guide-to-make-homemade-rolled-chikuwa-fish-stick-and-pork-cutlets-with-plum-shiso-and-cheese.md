Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
