Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
