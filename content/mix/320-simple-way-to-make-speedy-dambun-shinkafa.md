Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
