Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
