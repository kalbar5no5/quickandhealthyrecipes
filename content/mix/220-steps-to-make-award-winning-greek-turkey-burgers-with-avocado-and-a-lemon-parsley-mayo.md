Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
