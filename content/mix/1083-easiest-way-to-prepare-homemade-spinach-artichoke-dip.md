Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
