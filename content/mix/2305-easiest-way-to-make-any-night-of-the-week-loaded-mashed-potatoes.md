Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
