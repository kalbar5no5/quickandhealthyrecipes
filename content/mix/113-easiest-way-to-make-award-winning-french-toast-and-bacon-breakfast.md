Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
