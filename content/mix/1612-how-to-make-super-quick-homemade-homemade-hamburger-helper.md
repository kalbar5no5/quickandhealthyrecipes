Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
