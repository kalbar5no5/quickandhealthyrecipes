Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
