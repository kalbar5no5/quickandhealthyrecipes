Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
