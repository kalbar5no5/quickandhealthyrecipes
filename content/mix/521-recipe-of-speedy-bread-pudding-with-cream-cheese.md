Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
