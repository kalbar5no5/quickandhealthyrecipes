Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
