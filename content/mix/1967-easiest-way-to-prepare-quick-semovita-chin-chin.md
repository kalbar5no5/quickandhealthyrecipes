Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
