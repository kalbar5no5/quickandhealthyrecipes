Zazwyczaj do jej przyrządzenia wykorzystuje się mięso z szynki wieprzowej, ale z powodzeniem można zastąpić ją innymi rodzajami mięsa, np. kurczakiem.

Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
