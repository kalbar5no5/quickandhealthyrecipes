Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
