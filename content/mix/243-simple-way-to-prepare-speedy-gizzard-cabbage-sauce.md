How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
