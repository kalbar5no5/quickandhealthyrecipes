Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
