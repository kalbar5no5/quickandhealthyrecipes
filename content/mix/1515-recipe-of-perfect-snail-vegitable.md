Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
