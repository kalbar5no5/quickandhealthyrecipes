Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
