Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
