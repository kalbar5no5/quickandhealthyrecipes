Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
