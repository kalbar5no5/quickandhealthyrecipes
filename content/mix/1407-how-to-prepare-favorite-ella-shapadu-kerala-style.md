Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
