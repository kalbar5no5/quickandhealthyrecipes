Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
