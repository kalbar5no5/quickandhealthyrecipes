Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
