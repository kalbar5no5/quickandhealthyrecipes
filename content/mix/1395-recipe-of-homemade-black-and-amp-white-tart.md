Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
