Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body.
