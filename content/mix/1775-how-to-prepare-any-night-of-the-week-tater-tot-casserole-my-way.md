Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
