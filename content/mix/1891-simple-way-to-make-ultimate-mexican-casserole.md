Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
