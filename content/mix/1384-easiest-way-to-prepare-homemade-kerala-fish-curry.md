Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
