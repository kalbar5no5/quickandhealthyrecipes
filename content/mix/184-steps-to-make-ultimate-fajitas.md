Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
