Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts.

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them.
