Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
