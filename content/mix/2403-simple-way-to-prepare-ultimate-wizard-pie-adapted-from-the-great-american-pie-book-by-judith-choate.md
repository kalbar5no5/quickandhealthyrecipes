Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
