Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
