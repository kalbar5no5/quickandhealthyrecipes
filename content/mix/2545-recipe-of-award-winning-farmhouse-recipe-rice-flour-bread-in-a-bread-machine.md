Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
