Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
