Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
