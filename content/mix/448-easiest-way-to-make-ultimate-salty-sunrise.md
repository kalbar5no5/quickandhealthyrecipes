How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
