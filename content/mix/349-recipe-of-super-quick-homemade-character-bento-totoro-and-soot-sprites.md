Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
