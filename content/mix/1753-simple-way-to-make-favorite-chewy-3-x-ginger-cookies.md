Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
