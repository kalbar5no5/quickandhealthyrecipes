Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
