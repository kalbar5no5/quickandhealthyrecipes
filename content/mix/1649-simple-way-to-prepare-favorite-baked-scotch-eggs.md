Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
