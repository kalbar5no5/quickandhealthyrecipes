Making shrimp in the oven is easy! The time it takes for shrimp to bake in the oven depends on multiple factors, including, but not limited to, the temperature of the oven, the size of the prawn, and the cooking conditions. For example, my favorite Roasted Shrimp Recipe cooks on a sheet pan where the prawns are highly exposed, where heat and air can readily circulate. Sprinkle with parsley and serve warm, spooning sauce over shrimp.

For example, my favorite Roasted Shrimp Recipe cooks on a sheet pan where the prawns are highly exposed, where heat and air can readily circulate. Sprinkle with parsley and serve warm, spooning sauce over shrimp. Pour the butter mixture over the shrimp. If you have a mini toaster oven give it a try and see if you can save the hassle and time of using your main oven. The main oven takes longer to heat up and it warms the kitchen for a small amount of shrimp. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
