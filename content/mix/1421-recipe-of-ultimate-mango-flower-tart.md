Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
