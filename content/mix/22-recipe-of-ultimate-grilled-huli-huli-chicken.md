Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
