##### The ingredients needed to make CHEESE CAKE:

1. Prepare 100 grams butter
1. Make ready 1 packages digestive biscuit
1. Prepare 2 packages pineapple jelly
1. Prepare 1/4 cup water
1. Take 16 each kiri cheese cubes
1. Make ready 2 can nestle cream
1. Make ready 2 packages dream whip
1. Take 1 can pineapple slice
1. Prepare 8 each strawberry fruit(fresh)
1. Take 1 packages strawberry jelly

I added some cinnamon to the crust like one other reviewer did - and added some lemon juice and lemon extract to the filling - it was just a slight lemon flavor but perfect! Cheesecake is a time-consuming, somewhat expensive dessert to make. I&#39;d hate for you to wrap your springform pan in foil only to discover you didn&#39;t wrap it well enough and now water is seeping into your cheesecake before it even hits the oven. That has happened to me a handful of times and I MAKE FOOD FOR A LIVING.

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
