Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
