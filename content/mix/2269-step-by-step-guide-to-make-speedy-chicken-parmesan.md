Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
