Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
