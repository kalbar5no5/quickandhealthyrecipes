Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
