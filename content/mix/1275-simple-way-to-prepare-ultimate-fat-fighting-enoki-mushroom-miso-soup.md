Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
