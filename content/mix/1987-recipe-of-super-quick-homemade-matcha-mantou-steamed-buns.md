recipeingredient:
- "200 g cake flour or all purpose"
- "20 g wheat starch can replace with flour"
- "1 tbs matcha"
- "35 g sugar"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "140 g warm milk or water more or less depending on humidity"
- "1 tsp instant dry yeast or active dry"
- "1/2 tsp baking powder optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large bowl, whisk together dry ingredients (everything except milk) until well combined. If using active dry yeast, keep it separate."
- "Warm milk in a small saucepan over medium heat, constantly stirring until mixture becomes lukewarm. The milk should not be hotter than 40 degrees celsius."
- "Slowly pour in warm milk into dry ingredients, continuously stirring the misture until it forms a sticky dough. If using active dry yeast, let the yeast rest in the warm milk for about 5 minutes before pouring into the dry ingredients."
- "Knead dough until it becomes smooth and does not stick to your hands (around 10-20 minutes). Leave it in the large bowl and cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel. Let the dough rest until it doubles in size (45-60 mins)"
- "After the dough doubles in size, punch out the air and knead for about 5 minutes. Cover and let it rest for an additional 30 minutes."
- "Lightly dust your counter and dough with flour and roll it out into a large flat square/rectangle about 1/4 an inch thick. Swiss roll it up until it becomes a spiral log. Cut into 6-8 equal pieces. (You can also just roll the dough into a log and cut it into equal sized pieces :D)"
- "Lightly cover the dough pieces in plastic wrap and allow them to proof for around 20-30 minutes. (Important to get fluffy mantou!)"
- "Boil water in a steamer over high heat and steam the proofed mantou for 5 minutes (make sure to cover lid with a towel to prevent water from dripping onto your mantou!)."
- "Turn off the heat and let the mantou sit in your steamer for 5 minutes, without lifting the lid (the mantou may shrink if you skip this step). And thats it! Your steamed matcha buns are ready~ These are best served warm. Cover with plastic wrap or store in an airtight container while still warm to preserve moisture."
- "Notes: - Steamer temperatures may vary. If your mantou turns out a bit wrinkly, try steaming it over medium heat for 10-15 minutes. - I noticed that replacing the water with milk resulted in slightly lighter mantou, but did not have the mild milky taste - Add more matcha powder if you prefer a stronger matcha taste! You can also try adding two tablespoons of cocoa powder~ - The mantou will expand in the steamer so make sure they&#39;re not too close together c:"

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
