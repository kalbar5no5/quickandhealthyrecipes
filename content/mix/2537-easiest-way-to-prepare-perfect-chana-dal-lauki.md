Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
