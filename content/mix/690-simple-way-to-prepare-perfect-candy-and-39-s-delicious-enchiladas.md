If you&#39;re serving a crowd, cook a double batch and keep it warm in a Crock Pot. Canned sauces are great, but when fresh veggies are available it&#39;s fun to make a fresh sauce. After your first bite of these Thanksgiving Enchiladas, I predict this soft and creamy comforting dish just might become a new favorite after Thanksgiving. You can also swap in (or add in) any of your other leftovers from Thanksgiving such as mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, or squash. Use large flour tortillas - fill with chicken, mixture of jalapenos, onion and peppers and a little cheese and set in casserole dish opening side down. 

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
