Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
