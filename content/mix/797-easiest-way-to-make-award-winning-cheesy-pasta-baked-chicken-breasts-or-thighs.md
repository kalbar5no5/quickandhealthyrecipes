Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
