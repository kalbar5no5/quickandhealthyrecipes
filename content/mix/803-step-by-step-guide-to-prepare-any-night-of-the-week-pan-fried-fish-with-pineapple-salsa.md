Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
