Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
