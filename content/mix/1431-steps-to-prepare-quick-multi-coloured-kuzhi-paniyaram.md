Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
