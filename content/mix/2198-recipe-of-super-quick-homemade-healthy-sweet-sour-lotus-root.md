Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
