Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
