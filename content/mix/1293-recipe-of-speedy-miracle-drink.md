Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body.
