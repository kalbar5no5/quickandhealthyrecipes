Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
