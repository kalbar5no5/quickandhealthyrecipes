Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
