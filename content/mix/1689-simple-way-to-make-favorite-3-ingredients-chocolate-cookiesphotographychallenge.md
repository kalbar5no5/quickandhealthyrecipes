Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine.
