Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
