Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
