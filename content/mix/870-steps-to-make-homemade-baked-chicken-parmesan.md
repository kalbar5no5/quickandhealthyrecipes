Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
