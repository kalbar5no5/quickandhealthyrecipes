How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
