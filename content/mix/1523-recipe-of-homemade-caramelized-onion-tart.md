recipeingredient:
- "1 third quantity rough puff pastry or a sheet of ready rolled bought puff pastry allbutter"
- "1-2 large onions peeled and thinly sliced"
- " Olive oil and butter for sauteeing"
- " Black olives stoned"
- " Capers"
- " Parmesan cheese"
- " Salt and black pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Melt some butter with a splash of olive oil in a pan, add the onions and a good pinch of salt. Over a very low heat gently saute the onions, covered, and stirring occasionally, for about 15-20 minutes. You might need to add a splash of water to prevent them catching. When golden and sticky, transfer the onions to a plate to cool."
- "Preheat the oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Roll out the pastry to a rectangle, trim all the edges so you have a neat shape but also because otherwise the pastry will struggle to rise and flake properly. Score a margin round the edge, about a centimetre wide, don&#39;t cut all the way through, this will rise and create an edge. Brush the edge with milk."
- "Put the pastry in the oven and cook for about 10-12 minutes until light golden and puffed up. Remove from the oven and re-cut the inside square with a sharp knife, then push down the centre to create a dip."
- "Place the cooled onions in the tart case, add some torn black olives and scatter a few capers on top, then grate a little Parmesan over the top. Add lots of black pepper."
- "Return the tart to the oven and cook for another 5-7 minutes until golden. Allow to cool on a wire rack for a few minutes to keep the base crisp, and then serve warm."

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
