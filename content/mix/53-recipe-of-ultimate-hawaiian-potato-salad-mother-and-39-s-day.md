How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
