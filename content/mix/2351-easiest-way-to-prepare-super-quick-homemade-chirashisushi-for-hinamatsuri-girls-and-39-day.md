Hinamatsuri traces its origins to an ancient Japanese custom called hina-nagashi (雛流し, lit. &#34;doll floating&#34;), in which straw hina dolls are set afloat on a boat and sent down a river to the sea, supposedly taking troubles or bad spirits with them. This Japanese holiday is dedicated to girls and their families&#39; hopes for a bright and happy future. As a small child, I used to think that Japan&#39;s Girls&#39; Day (or Dolls&#39; Day)⁠—Hinamatsuri (ひな祭りor 雛祭り)⁠—was actually called &#39;Princess Day,&#39; as the Japanese word for doll, hina (雛) sounds similar to princess, hime. Hinamatsuri, the name of the celebration in Japan, is marked by families displaying a set of hina dolls in the house and serving special food delicacies that are ceremonially beautiful and delicious. The name Chirashizushi comes from the word Chirashi which literally means scattered. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
