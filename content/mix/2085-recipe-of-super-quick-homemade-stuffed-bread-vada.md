Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
