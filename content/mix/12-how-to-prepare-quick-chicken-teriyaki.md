How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
