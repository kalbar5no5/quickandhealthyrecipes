Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
