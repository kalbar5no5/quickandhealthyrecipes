Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
