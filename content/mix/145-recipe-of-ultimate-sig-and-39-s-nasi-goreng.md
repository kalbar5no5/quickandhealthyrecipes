I had some ground mince steak in freezer that needed using up. I made this for my granddaughter&#39;s friends as they came around. They asked for burgers and I had no buns. This is what I came up with. The first two dishes were two iconic Indonesian recipes. 

Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
