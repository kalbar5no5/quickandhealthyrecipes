GO TO RECIPE McDonald&#39;s Filet of Fish McDonald&#39;s At Home.

Next, wash and clean your fish, then cut all of the fins with a kitchen shears, pat the fish dry and move on to filleting each fish. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
