Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true.

These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood.

The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood.
