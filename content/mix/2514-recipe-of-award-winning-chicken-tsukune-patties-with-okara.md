Restaurants often skewer them, cook them on a grill and flavor them with a kind of teriyaki sauce. In this recipe, I show how to cook tsukune at home on a stove top with homemade tsukune sauce.

Restaurants often skewer them, cook them on a grill and flavor them with a kind of teriyaki sauce. In this recipe, I show how to cook tsukune at home on a stove top with homemade tsukune sauce. I shaped them like a small hamburger steak and cooked them in a frying pan. Using tongs to hold each Tsukune, pass two bamboo skewers through the center of each one and place the chicken on a grill. You can loosely wrap some aluminum foil around the skewers to keep them from burning on the grill. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
