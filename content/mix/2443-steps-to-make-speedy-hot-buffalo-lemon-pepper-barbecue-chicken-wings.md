Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
