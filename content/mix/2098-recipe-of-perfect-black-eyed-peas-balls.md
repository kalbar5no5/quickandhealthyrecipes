Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
