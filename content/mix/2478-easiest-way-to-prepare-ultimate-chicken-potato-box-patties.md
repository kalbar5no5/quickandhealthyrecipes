Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
