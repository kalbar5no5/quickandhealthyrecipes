Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
