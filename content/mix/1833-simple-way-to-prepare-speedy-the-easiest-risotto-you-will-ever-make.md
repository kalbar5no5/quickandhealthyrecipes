Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
