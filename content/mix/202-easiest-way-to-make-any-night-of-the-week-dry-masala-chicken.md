Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood.

Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body.
