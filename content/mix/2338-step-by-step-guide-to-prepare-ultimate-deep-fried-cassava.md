Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
