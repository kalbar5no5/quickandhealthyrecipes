Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
