Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
