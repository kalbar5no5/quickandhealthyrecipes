Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
