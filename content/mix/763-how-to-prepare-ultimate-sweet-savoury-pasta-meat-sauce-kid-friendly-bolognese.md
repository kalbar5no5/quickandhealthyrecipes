Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
