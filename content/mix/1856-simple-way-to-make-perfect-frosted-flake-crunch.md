How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
