Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
