Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
