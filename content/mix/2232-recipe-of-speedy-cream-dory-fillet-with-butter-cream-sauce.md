It&#39;s sold already filleted and is usually frozen or thawed by your local fishmonger. As soon as the butter has melted, pour this over the fish fillets. Garnish the fish with parsley to add some color. The fish fillets are seared on both sides in oil, then a lemon, garlic and butter are warmed and mixed together vigorously to emulsify. I use an empty mason jar to shake the sauce to thicken the butter and mix well with the lemon juice. 

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
