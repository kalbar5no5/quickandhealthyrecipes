Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
