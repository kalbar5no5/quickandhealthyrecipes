Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
