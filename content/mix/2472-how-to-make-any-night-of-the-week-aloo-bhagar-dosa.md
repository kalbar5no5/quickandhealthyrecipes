Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
