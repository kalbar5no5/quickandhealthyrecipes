Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
