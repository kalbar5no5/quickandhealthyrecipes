Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
