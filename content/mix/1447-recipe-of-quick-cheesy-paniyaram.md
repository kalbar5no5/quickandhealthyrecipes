Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
