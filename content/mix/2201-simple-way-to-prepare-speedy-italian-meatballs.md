- "1 1/2 cup Milk"
- "1 Chicken egg"
- "1 cup Freshly grated parmesan cheese medium grate plus more for service presentation"
- "1 medium White onion finely diced"
- "2 clove Garlic minced"
- "1 1/2 tbsp Fennel seed"
- "1 tbsp Italian Seasoning"
- "1 tbsp Extra virgin olive oil"
- "1 pinch Red pepper flake"

- "2 pinch Kosher salt"
- " Meatball Subs"
- "12 provolone or mozzarella or both slices"
- "6 Hoagie buns"
- " Meatballs for Pasta"
- "6 Servings cooked pasta"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat a large saute pan on low to medium-low heat. Toast the fennel seeds and red pepper flake in the pan for one to two minutes, taking care to not burn the spices. Add the olive oil and raise heat on the pan to medium."
- "Add the diced onion to the sauté pan and one pinch of Kosher salt. Sweat onions for 5-6 minutes and add minced garlic. Sweat for another 5-6 minutes. Stir in Italian seasoning, sweat another minute or two and remove from heat and allow to cool to around room temp."
- "Soak the bread pieces in the milk. In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. After the bread pieces have soaked up as much milk as possible, drain the excess and mash the bread with a fork so there are no large or medium sized chunks. Stir the bread and grated parmesan to combine in the large mixing bowl with the beaten egg mixture."
- "Add cooled onion mixture to bread mixture and stir to combine. Add ground pork and ground beef to the mixture along with the 1/2 TBSP of Kosher salt and 1/2 TBSP of freshly-ground black pepper. It&#39;s easiest (for me, anyway) to mix this with your hands. Don&#39;t worry about over-mixing. Make sure the entire mixture is as homogeneous as possible."
- "For Meatballs and pasta: Turn on your oven&#39;s broiler and put a rack about 3/4 of the way to the top. Form the meat mixture into 3-4 ounce balls (you&#39;ll have about 12-15 meatballs) and place them in a 9x13 roasting pan. Place them under the broiler for about 20 minutes or until the internal temperature is 165°F. The inside of the meatball will remain juicy, tender and flavorful. Serve with pasta and marinara and garnish with parmesan cheese."
- "For &#34;Meatball&#34; Sandwiches: Form the meat mixture into patties. Fry in a pan on the stove top. Melt cheese over the patties. Toast a split hoagie roll. Assemble sandwich with a few tsps of marinara."

Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
