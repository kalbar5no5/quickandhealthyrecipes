Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
