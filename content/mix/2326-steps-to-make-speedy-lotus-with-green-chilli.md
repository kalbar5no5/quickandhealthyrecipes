Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
