Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
