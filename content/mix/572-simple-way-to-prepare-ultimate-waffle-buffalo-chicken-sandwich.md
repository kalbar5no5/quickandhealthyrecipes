Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
