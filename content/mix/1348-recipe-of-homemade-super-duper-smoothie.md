Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
