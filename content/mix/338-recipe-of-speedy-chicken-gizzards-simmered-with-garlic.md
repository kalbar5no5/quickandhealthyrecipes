Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
