Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
