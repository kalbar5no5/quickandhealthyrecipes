Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
