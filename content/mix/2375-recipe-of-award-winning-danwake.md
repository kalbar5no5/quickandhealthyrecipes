Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
