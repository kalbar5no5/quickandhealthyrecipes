Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
