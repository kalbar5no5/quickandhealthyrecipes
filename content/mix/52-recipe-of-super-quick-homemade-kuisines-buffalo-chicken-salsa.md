Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
