Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body.
