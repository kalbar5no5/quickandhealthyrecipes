Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
