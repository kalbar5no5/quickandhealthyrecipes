Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
