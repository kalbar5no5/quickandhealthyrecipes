Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
