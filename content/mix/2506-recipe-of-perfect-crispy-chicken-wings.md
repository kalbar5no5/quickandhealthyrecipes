Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
