Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
