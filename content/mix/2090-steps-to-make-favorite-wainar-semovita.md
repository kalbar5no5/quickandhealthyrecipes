Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
