Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
