Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
