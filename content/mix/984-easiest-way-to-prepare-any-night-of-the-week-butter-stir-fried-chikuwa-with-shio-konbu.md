Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!
