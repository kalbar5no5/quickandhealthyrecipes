Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
