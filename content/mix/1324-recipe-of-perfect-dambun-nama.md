Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
