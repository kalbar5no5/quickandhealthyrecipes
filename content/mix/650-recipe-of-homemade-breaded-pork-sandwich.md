Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
