Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
