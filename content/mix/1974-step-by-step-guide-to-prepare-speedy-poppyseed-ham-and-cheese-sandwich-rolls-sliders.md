Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
