How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
