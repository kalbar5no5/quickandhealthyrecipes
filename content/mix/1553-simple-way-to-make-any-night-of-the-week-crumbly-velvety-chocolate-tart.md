Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
