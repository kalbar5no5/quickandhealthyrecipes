Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
