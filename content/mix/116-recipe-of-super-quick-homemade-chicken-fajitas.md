Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
