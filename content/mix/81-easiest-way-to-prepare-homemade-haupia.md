recipeinstructions:
- "Combine sugar and cornstarch in a stainless steel saucepan. I don&#39;t recommend a nonstick saucepan unless you happen to have a rubber whisk because you&#39;ll scratch it up with all of this stirring."

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
