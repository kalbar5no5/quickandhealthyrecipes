Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
