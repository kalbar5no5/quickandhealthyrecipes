Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
