Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
