Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
