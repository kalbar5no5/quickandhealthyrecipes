Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
