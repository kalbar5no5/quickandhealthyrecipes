recipeinstructions:
- "I used my Forman grill to grill the tilapia, if you don&#39;t have one use another type grill. This gives it the best flavor. It can be baked or pan seared as well. At any rate, prepare your method of cooking the fillet by heating it. If you&#39;re using a grill with a fire source be careful! Remember you&#39;ve coated the fillet with oil. Non stick surfaces you may or may not want to use pan coat to ensure your fillet stays beautifully intact :-)"
- "In a saute pan add about 2TBS olive oil and heat on medium. When the pan is hot enough that a piece of vegetable will sizzle but not fry, add all vegetables (Normandy mix, onions, and mushrooms) allow to cook for about 10-15 minutes, stir occasionally. It will take about 20 minutes to cook completely if cooking from frozen."
- "After the vegetables have been cooking for about 15 minutes see that the grill is hot and add fish. Depending on thickness of fillet will depend on how long you cook it. It flakes easily when done. If you insert a fork into the thickest part and it&#39;s no longer &#39;pink&#39;, it&#39;s done. Be sure to check on it often while preparing the next step."
- "While these other items are cooking lay spinach leaves on your plate. Followed by the cucumber slices then tomato and then pepper. Add a little drizzle of dressing if you like."
- "By this time all should be done. :-) enjoy!"

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
