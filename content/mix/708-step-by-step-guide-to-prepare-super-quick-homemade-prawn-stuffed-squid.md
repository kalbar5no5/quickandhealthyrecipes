How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
