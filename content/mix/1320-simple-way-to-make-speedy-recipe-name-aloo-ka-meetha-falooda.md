Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
