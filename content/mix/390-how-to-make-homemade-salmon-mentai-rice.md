Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
