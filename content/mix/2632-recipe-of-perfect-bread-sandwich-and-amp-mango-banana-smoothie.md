Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood.

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood.

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine.
