Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
