Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
