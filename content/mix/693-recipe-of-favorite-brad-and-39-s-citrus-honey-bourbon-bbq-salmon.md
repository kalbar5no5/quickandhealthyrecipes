Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
