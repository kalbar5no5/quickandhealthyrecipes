Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
