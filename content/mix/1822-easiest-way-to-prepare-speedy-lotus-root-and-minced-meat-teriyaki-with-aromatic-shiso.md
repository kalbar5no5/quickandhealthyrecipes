Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
