Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
