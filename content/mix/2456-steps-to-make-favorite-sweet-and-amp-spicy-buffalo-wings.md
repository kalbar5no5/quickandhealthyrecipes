Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
