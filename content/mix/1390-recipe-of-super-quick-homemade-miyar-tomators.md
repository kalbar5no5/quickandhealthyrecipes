Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true.

When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.
