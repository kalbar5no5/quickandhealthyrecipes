Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
