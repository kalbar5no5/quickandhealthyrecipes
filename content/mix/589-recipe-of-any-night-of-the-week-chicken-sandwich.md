Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!
