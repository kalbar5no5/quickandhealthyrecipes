How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
