Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
