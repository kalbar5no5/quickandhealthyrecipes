Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
