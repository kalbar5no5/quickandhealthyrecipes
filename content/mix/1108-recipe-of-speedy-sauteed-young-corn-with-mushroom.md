How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
