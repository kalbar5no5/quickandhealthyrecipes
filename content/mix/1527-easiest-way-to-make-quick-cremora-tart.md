Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
