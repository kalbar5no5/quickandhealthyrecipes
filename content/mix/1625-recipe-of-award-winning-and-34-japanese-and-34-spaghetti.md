Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
