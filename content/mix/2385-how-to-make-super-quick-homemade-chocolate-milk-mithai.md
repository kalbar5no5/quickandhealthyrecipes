Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
