Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
