Kiwi fruit goes on sale at the grocery store, so you buy a paper bag, just overflowing with delicious and gorgeous looking kiwis. You eat one or two of them and then they sit in your fridge for weeks before you sadly throw the rest in the trash. I&#39;m not thrilled to admit it, but I&#39;m definitely guilty of wasting my fair share of kiwis!

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
