recipeingredient:
- "4 medium beets"
- "1 bunch purple shiso"
- "10 fresh walnuts"
- "2 tbsp olive oil"
- "1 tbsp sherry vinegar"
- "to taste Salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Remove the greens from your beets. If they&#39;re nice greens, you can cook them like you would chard or collards. Try not to throw them away if you can avoid it."
- "In a pot, submerge your beets in water and get the stove on medium. If the water does come to a boil before they&#39;re done cooking, cut the heat to a gentle bubble. Root vegetables tend to get kinda water-logged bu a vigorous boiling."
- "Now, how do you know when your beets are done?... Well, I can&#39;t give you an exact time because nature makes beets of all different sizes. To check if they&#39;re done, you&#39;ll need a thin, pointy object of some type. If it seems like it&#39;s been long enough for the cooking to get to the middle, stab your biggest beet. It should yield readily to the point."
- "Then you just strain and rinse them under cold water. The skin should peel off easily by hand."
- "Dice the beets to around 1/2&#34; or so."
- "Julienne the shiso, not too fine, or it will bind up and get lost. Shuck the walnuts and break them up a bit. Toss it all together."
- "Add oil and vinegar and season to your liking with salt and pepper. Just try not to overpower that beet/shiso flavor."

Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
