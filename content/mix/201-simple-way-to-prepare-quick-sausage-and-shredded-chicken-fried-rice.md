Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine.
