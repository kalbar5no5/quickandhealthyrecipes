Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
