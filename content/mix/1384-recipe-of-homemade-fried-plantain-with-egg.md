Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
