Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
