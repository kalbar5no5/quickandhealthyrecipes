Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
