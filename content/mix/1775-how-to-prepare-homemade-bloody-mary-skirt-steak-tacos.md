Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at battling depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
