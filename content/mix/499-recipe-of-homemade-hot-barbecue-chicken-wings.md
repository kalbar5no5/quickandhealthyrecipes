Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!
