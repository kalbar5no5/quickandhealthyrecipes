Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
