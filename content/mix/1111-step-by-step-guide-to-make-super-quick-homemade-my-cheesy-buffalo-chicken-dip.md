Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
