Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
