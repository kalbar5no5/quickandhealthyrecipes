Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
