Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
