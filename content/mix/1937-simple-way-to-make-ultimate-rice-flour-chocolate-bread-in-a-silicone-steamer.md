Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
