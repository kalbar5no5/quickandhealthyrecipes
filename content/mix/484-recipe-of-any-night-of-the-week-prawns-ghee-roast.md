Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed.
