Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
