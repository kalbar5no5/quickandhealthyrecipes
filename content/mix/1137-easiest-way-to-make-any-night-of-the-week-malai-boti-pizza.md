Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
