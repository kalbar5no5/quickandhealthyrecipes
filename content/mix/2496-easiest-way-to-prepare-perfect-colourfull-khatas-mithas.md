How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
