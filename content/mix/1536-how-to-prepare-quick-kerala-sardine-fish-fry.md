Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
