Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
