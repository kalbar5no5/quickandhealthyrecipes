Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
