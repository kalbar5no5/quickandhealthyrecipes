Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
