Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
