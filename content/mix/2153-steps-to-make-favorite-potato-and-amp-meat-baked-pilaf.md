Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
