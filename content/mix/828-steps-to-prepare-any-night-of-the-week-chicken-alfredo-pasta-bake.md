Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
