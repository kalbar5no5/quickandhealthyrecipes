Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
