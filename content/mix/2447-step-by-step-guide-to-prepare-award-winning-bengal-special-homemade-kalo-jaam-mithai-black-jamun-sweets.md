Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
