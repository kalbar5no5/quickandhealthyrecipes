Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
