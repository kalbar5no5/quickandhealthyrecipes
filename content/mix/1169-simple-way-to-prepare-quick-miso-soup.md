How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
