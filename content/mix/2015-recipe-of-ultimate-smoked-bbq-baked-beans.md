Barbecue beans have been a staple at The Meatwave pretty much since its inception. Since then, I&#39;ve relied on two recipes to serve me well throughout the years—Alton Brown&#39;s Once and Future Bean and Mike Mills&#39; Tangy Pit Beans. The recipes are radically different, one begins with dried beans and requires almost a day from start to finish, while the other utilizes canned beans and can be. Or opt for completely fat free baked beans. Choose lean grilled chicken breast or fish as your main protein and use your remaining allowed fat portion in an on-plan salad dressing for a big leafy green side salad. 

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
