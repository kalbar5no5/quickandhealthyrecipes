Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
