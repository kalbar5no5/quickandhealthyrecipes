Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
