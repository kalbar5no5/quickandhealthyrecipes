How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
