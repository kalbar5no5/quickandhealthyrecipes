recipeinstructions:
- "Prep Time: 1 to 2 hours depending on your experience/ingredients. Cook Time: 27 minutes including the dumplings. There are two main sequences to this meal. One for the Chicken Soup and one for the Dumplings. * NOTE: If you do not have access to a Pressure Cooker, you may substitute for a 6 quart Crock Pot - and increase the cooking time to approximately 6 hours on high. If using frozen chicken breast increase cooking time to approximately 8 hours for crock pot and 25 minutes for high pressure cooker."
- "Add all the &#34;Chicken Soup&#34; ingredients to a 6 quart Pressure Cooker and give it a few good stirs. * NOTE: do Not add any water, the 32 ounces of broth will be substituting the water."
- "I used an Electric Pressure Cooker. Set the Heat to High Pressure and Timing to 17 Minutes. You will need to lock the lid and set it up for High Pressure following your Pressure Cooker&#39;s Safety Guidelines. It should take about 2 minutes to pressurize leaving you a full 15 minutes to cook under High Pressure."
- "When finished cooking, slowly release the pressure using the Quick Release function following your pressure cooker&#39;s safety measures. This sequence is now finished. * NOTE: now is a perfect time for a taste test to modify your seasonings if needed. Also check the tenderness of the chicken if you were using frozen chicken. An additional 3 to 5 minutes of high pressure cooking may be necessary."
- "Switch the pressure cooker to &#34;Steam&#34; Mode or &#34;High&#34; Heat. Leave the lid on but allow the pressure to escape through the &#34;Steam Vents&#34;, as we do Not want to allow the pressure to build up. * NOTE: Cooking dough under high pressure will cause the biscuits to &#34;Foam&#34; and clog the vents, an obvious safety concern."
- "Now for the second and final part, the Dumplings. First Mix all the Dry Ingredients in a medium glass bowl. After the dry ingredients are mixed in, add the Whole Milk while folding/stirring with a large metal spoon until thoroughly mixed. * NOTE: you may substitute by simply using your favorite brand of canned biscuits."
- "By now the fragrant chicken soup should be boiling or very close to a low boil. If not double check your settings as it needs to be boiling hot to cook the dough properly, otherwise it will come out uncooked in the center. Carefully &#34;Drop&#34; large sized balls of the dough into the Pressure Cooker and cover with the lid. Again allowing the steam to safely escape. Cook for 10 minutes on High Heat with the lid on. After 10 minutes your meal is ready to serve. Enjoy."

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
