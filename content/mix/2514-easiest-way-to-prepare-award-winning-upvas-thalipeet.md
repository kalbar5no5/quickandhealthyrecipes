Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
