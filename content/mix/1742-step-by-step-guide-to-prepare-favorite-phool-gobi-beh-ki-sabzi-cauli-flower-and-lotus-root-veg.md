Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
