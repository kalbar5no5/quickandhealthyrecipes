Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!
