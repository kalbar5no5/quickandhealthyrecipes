Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
