Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
