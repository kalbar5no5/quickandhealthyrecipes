Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
