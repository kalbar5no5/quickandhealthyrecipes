Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
