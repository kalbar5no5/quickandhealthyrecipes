recipeingredient:
- "48 oz root beer"
- "2 cup sugar for glaze"
- "2 large jalapenos minced optional"
- "4 tbsp cornstarch"
- "20 chicken wings"
- "2 large arms of ginger root minced"
- "1 1/2 cup water"
- "1 1/2 cup sugar for ginger"
- "1 tbsp butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large saucepan reduce, on medium heat, the root beer by about half."
- "Add the sugar to the root beer, and reduce heat to low heat."
- "In another small saucepan boil the minced ginger in the water until soft."
- "Take back about a half cup of the root beer solution from the saucepan and let it cool a bit, while still stirring the root beer in the saucepan."
- "Add the jalapenos to the saucepan, if you are using jalapenos."
- "When the set aside root beer is cooled a bit, add the cornstarch to that cooled bit of root beer, and stir.  If the root beer is too hot, you will create dumplings, so make sure it is cool."
- "When the cornstarch is thoroughly incorporated into a somewhat opaque but loose solution, add it to the saucepan rootbeer, but stir frantically while you pour in the cornstarch solution.  If the cornstarch solution is not loose enough, you may need to add a bit more rootbeer, slowly."
- "When the saucepan mixture begins to tighten up into a pudding consistency, turn off the heat."
- "The ginger should be pretty well boiled by now, so add the sugar for the ginger to the ginger and water mixture."
- "Reduce the ginger sugar water considerably, until the mixture is thick, gooey, and a bead of the mixture in cold water turns hard."
- "Pour the ginger solution into a buttered sheet pan, and spread to cool."
- "Drop the chicken into a bowl with some of the glaze, and mix it up."
- "After a few minutes, drop the wings into a hot oil-filled wok or deep fryer, and cook them until they are at least 160°F through and through."
- "Remove the chicken and place onto a cookie sheet."
- "Break the cooled ginger solution into little tiny bits."
- "Reglaze the chicken with the root beer glaze, sprinkle with ginger bits, and then broil the chicken for about another 5 minutes.  This ensures the glaze is up to a safe temp."
- "Cool, serve, and enjoy!"

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
