Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
