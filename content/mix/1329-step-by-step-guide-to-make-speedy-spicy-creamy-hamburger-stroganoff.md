Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
