Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
