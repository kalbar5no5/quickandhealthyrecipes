Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
