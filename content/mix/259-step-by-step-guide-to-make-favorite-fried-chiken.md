Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
