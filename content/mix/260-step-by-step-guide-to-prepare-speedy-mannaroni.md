Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
