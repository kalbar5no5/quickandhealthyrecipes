Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
