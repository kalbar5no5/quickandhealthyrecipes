Perilla frutescens var. crispa, also known by its Japanese name shiso, is a cultigen of Perilla frutescens, a herb in the mint family Lamiaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of China and India, but is now found worldwide. Shiso can be served either fresh or pickled — we&#39;ve even seen it fried — and frequently makes appearances in sushi rolls. Iimori specifically singles out the ume shiso roll, a somewhat common vegetarian maki roll that is made with pickled plums and shiso.

Green shiso is a bit spicy in flavor with a hint of cinnamon. The leaves are rich in calcium and iron, and because of its strong flavor, can stand up to such things as pickling. The entire plant can be consumed, and its seeds are used to as an edible oil in places such as Korea, or ground and used as seasoning. Shiso, the aromatic heart-shaped leaf with a saw-toothed edge, is probably most familiar to Americans as a sushi garnish. Shiso (pronounced &#34;she-so&#34;) is the Japanese name for an annual herb called Perilla, which belongs to the mint family. 

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
