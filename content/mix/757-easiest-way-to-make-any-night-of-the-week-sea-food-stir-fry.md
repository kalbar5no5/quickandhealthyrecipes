Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
