Instead of using philly cream cheese use an organic and/or grass-fed version. There are plenty of raw milk cheeses, grass-fed cheese, even yogurt cultured cheeses. I do agree about the mayo as most brands are made with soy and/or canola oil - no bueno. See recipes for Mayo dip by Nancy, Mayo-ketshup Garlic Dip too.

This spread is great for adding a little pizazz to a humdrum sandwich. It has creaminess from the mayo, zing from the mustard, and sweetness from the honey. It can really go with almost any sandwich. 

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
