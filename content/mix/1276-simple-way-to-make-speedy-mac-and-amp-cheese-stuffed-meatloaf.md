Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
