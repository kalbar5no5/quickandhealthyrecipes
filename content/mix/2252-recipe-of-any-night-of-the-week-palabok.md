Pancit Palabok (pahn-sit pah-lah-bok) is a noodle dish flavored with shrimp gravy and dressed up with assorted toppings. Made from scratch, palabok sauce would be prepared with stock from the head and shells of the shrimp used in the dish and if you&#39;re from Pampanga, supplemented with pork stock since the proteins in palabok include pork in. Pancit Palabok is another Filipino noodle dish with a Chinese origin. It&#39;s called palabok because of the bright colored orange shrimp-flavoured thick sauce covered the thin rice noodles. 

Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
