Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
