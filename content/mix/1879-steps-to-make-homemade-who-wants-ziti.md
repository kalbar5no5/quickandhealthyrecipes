Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
