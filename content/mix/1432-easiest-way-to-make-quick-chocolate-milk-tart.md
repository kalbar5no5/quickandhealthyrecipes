Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
