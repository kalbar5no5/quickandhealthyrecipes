Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
