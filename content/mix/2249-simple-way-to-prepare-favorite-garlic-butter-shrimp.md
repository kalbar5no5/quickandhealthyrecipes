Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
