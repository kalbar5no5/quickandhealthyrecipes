How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
