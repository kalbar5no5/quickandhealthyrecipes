Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
