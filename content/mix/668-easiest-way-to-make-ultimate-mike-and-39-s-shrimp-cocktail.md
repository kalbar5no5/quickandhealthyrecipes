Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
