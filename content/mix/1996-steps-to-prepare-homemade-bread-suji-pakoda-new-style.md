Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
