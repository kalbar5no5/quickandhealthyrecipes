Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
