Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
