Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
