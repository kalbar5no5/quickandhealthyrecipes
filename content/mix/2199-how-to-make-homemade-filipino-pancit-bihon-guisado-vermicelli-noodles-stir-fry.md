Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
