Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
