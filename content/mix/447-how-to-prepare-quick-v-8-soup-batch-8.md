Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
