Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
