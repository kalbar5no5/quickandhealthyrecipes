Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
