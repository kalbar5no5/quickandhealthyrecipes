How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
