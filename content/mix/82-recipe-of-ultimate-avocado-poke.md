Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
