Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
