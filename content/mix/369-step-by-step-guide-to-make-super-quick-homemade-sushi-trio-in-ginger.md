- "Repeat the same step with Tobiko."
- "Cut the ends off the rolls. Cut into 6 pieces. Arrange on serving plate. Slice the octopus into thin slices. Arrange octopus pieces around the plate."
- "I should have put more wasabi in the sushi seasoning. The wasabi taste was too subtle. And should have made and should have put more pickled ginger in the rolls. The sushi tasted good but needed more wasabi and pickled ginger."

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
