Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
