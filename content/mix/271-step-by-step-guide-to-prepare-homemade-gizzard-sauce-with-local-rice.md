Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
