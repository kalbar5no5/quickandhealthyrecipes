How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
