Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
