Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
