Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
