Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
