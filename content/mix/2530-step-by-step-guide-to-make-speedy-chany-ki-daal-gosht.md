Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
