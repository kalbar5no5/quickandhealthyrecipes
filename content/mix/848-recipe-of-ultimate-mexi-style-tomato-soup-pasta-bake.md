Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
