Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
