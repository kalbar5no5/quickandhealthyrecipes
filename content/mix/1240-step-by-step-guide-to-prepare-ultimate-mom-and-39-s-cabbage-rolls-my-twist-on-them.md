My mom recommends trimming a little bit of the thick spine off each of the cabbage leaves to make them easier to roll. Just be careful not to cut right through the leaf. There isn&#39;t a specific amount of meat mixture to put inside each cabbage roll because it depends on the size of the leaf. Chop onion, celery, tomato and mix with rice and vegetarian ground beef, if using, and salt and pepper to taste.

There isn&#39;t a specific amount of meat mixture to put inside each cabbage roll because it depends on the size of the leaf. Chop onion, celery, tomato and mix with rice and vegetarian ground beef, if using, and salt and pepper to taste. Pour a small portion of the tomato liquid from the can in to the bottom of the roasting pan. Place one layer of the cabbage leaves over the liquid to prevent any burning or browning of the cabbage rolls.

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
