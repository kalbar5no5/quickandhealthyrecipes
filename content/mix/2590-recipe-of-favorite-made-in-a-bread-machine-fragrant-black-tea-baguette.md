- "60 grams Cake flour"
- "70 grams Bread flour"
- "100 grams Water"
- "10 grams Black tea leaves"
- "3 grams Salt"
- "3 to 4 drops Lemon juice"
- "2 grams Dry yeast"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat water in a small pan. Turn the heat off right before it boils, and add the tea leaves. Set it aside to cool for about 10 minutes. When it&#39;s cooled down, transfer it (including the tea leaves) into the bread machine."
- "Put all other ingredients into the bread machine. Knead for 5 to 7 minutes until the dough is mixed well. Turn it off, and transfer into a bowl."
- "Cover with plastic wrap and leave it aside for the first rising. During wintertime, it took about 1.5 hours to rise until it was 2.5 or 3 times its original volume."
- "Dust your work surface and take out the dough. Bring it together into a ball and let it sit for about 15 minutes. Roll it out long and thin. Take care not to pop the air bubbles."
- "Divide it into 2 portions to make 2 baguettes. Shape it with a bread mat for the second rising, which takes 30 minutes. Watch the time, and preheat the oven (with its tray) at 250℃."
- "Transfer the bread dough with parchment paper onto the hot oven tray. Make slits on the surface, and spray a decent amount of water onto the dough."
- "Bake for 30 to 35 minutes. You can really smell the tea!"
- "It might not really show in the photo, but mine was bumpy with some air holes. That didn&#39;t turn out well... I&#39;m going to try again to get an even bumpier cross-section!!"

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
