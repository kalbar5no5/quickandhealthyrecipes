Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
