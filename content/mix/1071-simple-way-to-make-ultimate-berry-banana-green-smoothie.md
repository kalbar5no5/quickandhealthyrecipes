Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
