Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
