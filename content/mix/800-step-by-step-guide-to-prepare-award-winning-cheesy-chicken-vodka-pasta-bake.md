Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
