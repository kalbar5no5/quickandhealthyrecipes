Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
