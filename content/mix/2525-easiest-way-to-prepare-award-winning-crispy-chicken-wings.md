Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
