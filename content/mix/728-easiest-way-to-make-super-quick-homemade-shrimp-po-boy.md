Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
