Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
