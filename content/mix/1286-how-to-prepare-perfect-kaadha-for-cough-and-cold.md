Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
