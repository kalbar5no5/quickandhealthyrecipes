Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
