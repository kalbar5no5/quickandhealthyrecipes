Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
