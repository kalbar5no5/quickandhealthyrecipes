Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
