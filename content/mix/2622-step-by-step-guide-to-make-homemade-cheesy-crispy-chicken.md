Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
