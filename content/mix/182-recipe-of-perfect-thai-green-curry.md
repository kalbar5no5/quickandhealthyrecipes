Thai green curry is one of the most popular of current trending foods in the world. It's enjoyed by millions daily. It's simple, it is fast, it tastes yummy. Thai green curry is something which I've loved my entire life. They're nice and they look wonderful.

This is a classic Thai green curry (kaeng kiau wan) and my favorite curry of all time! You can substitute chicken or tofu for the pork, but make sure you serve it with lots of jasmine rice. Thai green curry is a variety of curry from Thailand using coconut milk and fresh green chillies. This recipe in particular is for those who are after something super simple, a quick to throw.

##### The ingredients needed to make Thai green curry:

1. Get 3 chicken breasts. Sliced
1. Get Handful baby corn on cob
1. Prepare Handful mangetout
1. Make ready Cup Savoy cabbage
1. Make ready Tin light coconut milk
1. Prepare Tablespoon Thai green curry paste
1. Make ready Splash fish sauce
1. Make ready 2 nests of noodles
1. Prepare  Salt and pepper


The curry is green in color, spicy, aromatic, sweet and savory at the same time. Thai green curry is so delicious, specially when served with steaming white jasmine rice. There&#39;s a common misconception that Thai green curry is green in color from all the Thai basil used in the recipe. While there is often Thai sweet basil tossed into the curry, the real green color of the curry comes from Thai green chilies that are the main ingredient of the Thai green curry paste used to make the curry.

There&#39;s a common misconception that Thai green curry is green in color from all the Thai basil used in the recipe. While there is often Thai sweet basil tossed into the curry, the real green color of the curry comes from Thai green chilies that are the main ingredient of the Thai green curry paste used to make the curry. Return chicken to the skillet, stirring to coat with the curry mixture. The &#34;sweet&#34; in the Thai name (wan means &#39;sweet&#39;) refers to the particular color green itself and not to the taste of the curry. As this is a Thai curry based on coconut milk and fresh green chillies, the color comes out creamy mild green or, as this color is called in Thai, &#34;sweet green&#34;. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
