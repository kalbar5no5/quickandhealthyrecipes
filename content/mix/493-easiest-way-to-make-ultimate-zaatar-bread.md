Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
