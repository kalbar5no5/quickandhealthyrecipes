Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
