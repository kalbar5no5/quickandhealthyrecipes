Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
