Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
