Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
