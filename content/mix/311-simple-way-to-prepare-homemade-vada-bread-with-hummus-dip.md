Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.
