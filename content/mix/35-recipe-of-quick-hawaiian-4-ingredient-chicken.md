Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
