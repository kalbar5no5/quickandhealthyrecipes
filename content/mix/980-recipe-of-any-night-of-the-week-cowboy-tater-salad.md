Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
