How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!
