Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
