Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
