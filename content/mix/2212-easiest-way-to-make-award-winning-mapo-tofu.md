Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
