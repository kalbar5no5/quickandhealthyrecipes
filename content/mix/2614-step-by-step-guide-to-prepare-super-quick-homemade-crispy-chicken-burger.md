Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
