Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
