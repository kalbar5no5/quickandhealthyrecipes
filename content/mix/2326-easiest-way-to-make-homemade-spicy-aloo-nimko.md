Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
