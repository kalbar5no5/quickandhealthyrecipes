Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
