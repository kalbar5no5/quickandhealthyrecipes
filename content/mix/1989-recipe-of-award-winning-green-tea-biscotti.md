Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!
