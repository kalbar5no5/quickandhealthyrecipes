How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
