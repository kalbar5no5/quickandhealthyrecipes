Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
