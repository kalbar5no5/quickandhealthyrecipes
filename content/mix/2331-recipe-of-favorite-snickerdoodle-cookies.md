Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
