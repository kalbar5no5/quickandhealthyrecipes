Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
