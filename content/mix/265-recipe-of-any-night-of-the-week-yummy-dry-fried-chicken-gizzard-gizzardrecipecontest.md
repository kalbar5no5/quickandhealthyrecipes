Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
