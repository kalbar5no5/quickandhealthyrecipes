Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
