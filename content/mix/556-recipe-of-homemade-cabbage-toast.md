Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
