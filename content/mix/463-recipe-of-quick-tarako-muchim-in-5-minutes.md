- "...and then mix it up with the mentaiko mix with your hands. Transfer to a serving plate, and drizzle on a little sesame oil, too. It&#39;s soooo good."
- "You can salt and prep the turnips in advance, have the mentaiko mixture ready to go separately, and refrigerate them both in advance. Toss them together just before serving, okay? If you mix them together in advance they will become watery."

Muchim just means tossed salad in Korean. And it&#39;s become one of my favorite banchans! I didn&#39;t like it as a kid. but as I grow older and pay attention to my diet, it&#39;s a no-brainer. Dubu muchim originally comes from Korean temple food. The more traditional Korean ingredients used for this easy tofu recipe are greens such as Easy Tofu Broccoli with Sesame Oil (Dubu Muchim). 

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
