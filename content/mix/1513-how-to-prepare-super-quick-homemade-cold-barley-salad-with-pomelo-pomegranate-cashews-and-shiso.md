Pell the pomelo and separate into segments. Place the fruit in a bowl. When ready to serve, pour off any of the juice (I reserve for dressings). Pomelo salad, like most traditional Thai salads, needs to be consumed immediately after it&#39;s tossed. That is when the flavor rises to a crescendo before it steadily and rapidly declines. 

Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
