Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
