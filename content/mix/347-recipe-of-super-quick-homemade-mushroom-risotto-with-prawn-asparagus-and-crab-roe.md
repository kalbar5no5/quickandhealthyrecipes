Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
