Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
