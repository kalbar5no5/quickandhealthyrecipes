Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
