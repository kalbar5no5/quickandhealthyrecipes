Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
