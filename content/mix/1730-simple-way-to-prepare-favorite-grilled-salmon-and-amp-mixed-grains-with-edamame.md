Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
