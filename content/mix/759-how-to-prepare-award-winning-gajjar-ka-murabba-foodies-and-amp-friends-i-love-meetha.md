Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
