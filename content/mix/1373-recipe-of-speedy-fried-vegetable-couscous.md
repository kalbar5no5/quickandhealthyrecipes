Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
