Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
