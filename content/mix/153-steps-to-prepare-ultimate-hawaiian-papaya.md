Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
