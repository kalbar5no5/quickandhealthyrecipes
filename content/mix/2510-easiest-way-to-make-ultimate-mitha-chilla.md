Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
