How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
