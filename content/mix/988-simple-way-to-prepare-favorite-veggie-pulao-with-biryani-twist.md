The fresh vegetables in the biryani are prepared separately along with spices, while the rice is par-boiled. Also, they think that what vegetarians refer to Vegetable Biryani is actually Pulao. To those people, I would like to say &#34;My dear friends, please research and Anyway, coming to the point, I must say that there are many variants of Biryani, each having a unique taste and cultural twist. Veg pulao recipe or vegetable pulao is another rice delicacy made by mixing veggies and rice. Earlier I shared a veg biryani in cooker recipe which was quite easy and quick to prepare and that was a bit spicy flavorful rice dish and veg pulao recipe is a bit less spicy, light and yet is very flavorful. 

Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
