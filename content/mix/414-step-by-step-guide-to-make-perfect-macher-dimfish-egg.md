Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
