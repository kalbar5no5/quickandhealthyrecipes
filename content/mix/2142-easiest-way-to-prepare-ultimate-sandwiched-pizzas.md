Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
