Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
