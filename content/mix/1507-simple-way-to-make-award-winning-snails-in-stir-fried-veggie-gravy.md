Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
