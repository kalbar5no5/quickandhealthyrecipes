Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
