How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
