Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
