Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
