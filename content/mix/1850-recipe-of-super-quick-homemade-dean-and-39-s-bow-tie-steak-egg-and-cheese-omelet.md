How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
