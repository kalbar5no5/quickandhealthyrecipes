Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
