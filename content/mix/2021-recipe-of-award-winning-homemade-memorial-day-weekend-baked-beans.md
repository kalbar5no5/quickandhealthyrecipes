Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
