Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine.
