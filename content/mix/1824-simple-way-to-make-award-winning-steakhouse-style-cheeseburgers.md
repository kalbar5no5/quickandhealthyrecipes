recipeinstructions:
- "I just like having a picture of everything I used together in case I forget an ingredient for later!"
- "If adding bacon, cook four slices of bacon until really crispy, and once cool, crumble with a fork or your fingers. Save the other six for topping burgers later"
- "Add all the ingredients together into the beef and combine well"
- "Divide the beef into two halves, and then divide each half into three equal portions"
- "Flatten each patty to about half an inch, and press your thumb into the center to create a well. This prevents the burgers from shrinking too much when frying"
- "Heat a nonstick skillet on medium heat and then pan fry the burgers 3 at a time. The cheese will ooze out in spots, that&#39;s okay and delicious once it browns and sticks to the burger!"
- "Cover and cook for roughly 15 minutes, or until desired doneness. Test one with a meat thermometer to be sure!"
- "I lay my bacon and cheese on top while still in the skillet, then add a splash of water and quickly cover for 30 seconds to melt the cheese perfectly. Rest burgers on paper towels for a minute or two to drain"
- "Add your favorite toppings (mine is just onion, lettuce, and more steak sauce) Enjoy!"

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.
