Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
