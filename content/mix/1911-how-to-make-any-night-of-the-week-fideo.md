Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
