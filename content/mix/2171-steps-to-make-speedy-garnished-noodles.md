Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
