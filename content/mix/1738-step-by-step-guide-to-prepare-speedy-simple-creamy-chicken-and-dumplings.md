Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
