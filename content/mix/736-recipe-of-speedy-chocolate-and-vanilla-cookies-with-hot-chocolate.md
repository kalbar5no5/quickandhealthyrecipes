Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
