Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
