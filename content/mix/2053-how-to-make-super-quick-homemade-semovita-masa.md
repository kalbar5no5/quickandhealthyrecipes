Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
