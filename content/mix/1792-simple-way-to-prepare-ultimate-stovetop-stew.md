Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
