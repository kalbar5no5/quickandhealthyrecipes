Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
