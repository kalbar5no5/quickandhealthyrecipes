Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
