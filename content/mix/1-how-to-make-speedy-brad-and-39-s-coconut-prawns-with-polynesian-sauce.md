At this point they can be placed on waxed paper and refrigerated until ready Excellent recipe and use unsweetened coconut rather than the sweetened type. I use bottled Thai Peanut Sauce as a yummy dip and serve it all up. Give these beautiful king prawns a touch of the caribbean - rolled in flaky coconut then fried to crispy perfection - before serving with either a zesty lemon, or spicy fish and lime sauce. When the coconut has turned light brown on one side, turn the prawns over and cook until crisp and golden on both sides.

When the coconut has turned light brown on one side, turn the prawns over and cook until crisp and golden on both sides. Coconut chicken bake is a recipe inspired by the flavours of island favourite of lu/palusami where meat or just plain coconut cream is baked in taro leaves in a umu (earth oven). Coconut Lamb &amp; Vegetable Curry with Cassava. The ultimate island comfort food, this well loved island pudding and is delicious. 

Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
