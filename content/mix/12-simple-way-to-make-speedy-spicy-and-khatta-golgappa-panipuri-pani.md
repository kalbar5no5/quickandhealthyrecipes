How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
