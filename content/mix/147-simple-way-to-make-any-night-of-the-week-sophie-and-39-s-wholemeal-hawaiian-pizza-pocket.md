These pizza pockets are particularly good for kids who have access to microwave ovens at school (like many high schoolers do). In order to keep the sandwiches safe until lunchtime, place frozen. Hot Pockets had to eventually make their Limited Edition Spicy Hawaiian Style Pizza because they were running out of normal pizza varieties to stuff into their crust. There are currently Hot Pockets in the following pizza varieties: supreme, cheese, pepperoni, sausage, and pepperoni and sausage. 

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
