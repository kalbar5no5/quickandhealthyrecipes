Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
