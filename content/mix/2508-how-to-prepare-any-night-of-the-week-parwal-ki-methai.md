Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
