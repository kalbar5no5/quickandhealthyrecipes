Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
