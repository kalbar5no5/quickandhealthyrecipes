Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
