Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
