Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
