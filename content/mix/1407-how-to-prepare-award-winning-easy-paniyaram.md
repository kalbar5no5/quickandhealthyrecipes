Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
