Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
