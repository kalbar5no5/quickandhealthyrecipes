Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
