Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
