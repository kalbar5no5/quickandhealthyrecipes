Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
