Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
