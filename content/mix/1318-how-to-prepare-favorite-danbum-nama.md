Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
