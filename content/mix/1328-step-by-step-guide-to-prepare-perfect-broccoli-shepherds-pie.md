Hello everybody, it is Jim, welcome to our recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, broccoli shepherds pie. One of my favorites food recipes. This time, I am going to make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Broccoli Shepherds Pie is one of the most popular of current trending foods in the world. It's easy, it is fast, it tastes delicious. It's enjoyed by millions every day. They are nice and they look wonderful. Broccoli Shepherds Pie is something which I've loved my entire life.

Transfer to the baking dish and top with mashed potatoes. A couple notes: Though the recipe calls for chopped chicken or turkey, I often use browned ground turkey or pork sausage (since we have been raising hogs, we have a lot of good, lean pork sausage on hand), and it&#39;s delicious! In another bowl, combine eggs, milk, biscuit mix, salt and pepper; mix well. Pour over broccoli mixture; toss gently.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can have broccoli shepherds pie using 14 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

The use of lamb, the smoky, heather taste of GuinnessÂ® Draught (Irish, I admit), and the topping of sharp Cheddar and smoked paprika give this version its unique, smoky-sweet flavor. Heat mashed potatoes according to package directions and set aside. Cut the salmon into bite-sized pieces. This Black Lentil Charred Broccoli Shepherd&#39;s Pie is an extremely warm and comforting entree.

Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
