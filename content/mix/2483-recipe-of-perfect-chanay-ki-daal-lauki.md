Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
