Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
