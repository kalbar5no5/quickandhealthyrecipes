- "Heat oil to 170°C to 180°C. The right temperature can be tested by dropping a little bit of batter into the oil. If the batter sinks a little into the oil, then comes back the surface, the temperature is right for frying. *See my &#39;Tempura Batter&#39; recipe https://cookpad.com/uk/recipes/1471911-tempura-batter"
- "Dip the pieces into Tempura Batter and slide them into the oil. Do not fry too many at once."
- "When the pieces are small such as beans, carrot or onion, fry the pieces in small bunches."
- "Turn them over a few times. When they are cooked and the batter is light golden and crispy, take them out and lay them on a rack to drain the oil."
- "Place a sheet of paper on a plate and arrange the Tempura so it presents well. The paper helps soak up any excess oil and makes the dish look nice."
- "Serve with Tentsuyu (dipping sauce). *It is often served with grated Daikon radish and grated Ginger to add extra flavour to the Tentsuyu dipping sauce. Sometimes Tempura are served with salt. My grandfather used to love sweet potato Tempura with BBQ sauce…"

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
