Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
