Make cheesecake mixture: In a large bowl using a hand mixer, beat cream cheese and sugar until combined. Cheesecake came out perfect, I just used strawberry cake mix for strawberry cake layers. Followed the frosting recipe exactly but when I applied to cake it became very runny. I made it the day before so it was refrigerated overnight and removed from fridge right before I frosted cake. This easy No Bake Strawberry Cheesecake recipe is full of strawberry flavor! 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
