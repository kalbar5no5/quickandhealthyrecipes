How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
