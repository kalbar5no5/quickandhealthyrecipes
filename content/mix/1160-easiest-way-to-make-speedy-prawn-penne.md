Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
