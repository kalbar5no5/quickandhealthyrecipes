Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
