Semolina is a high-gluten flour made from hard durum wheat. It has a rather coarse texture, yellow color, and is high in gluten protein.

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
