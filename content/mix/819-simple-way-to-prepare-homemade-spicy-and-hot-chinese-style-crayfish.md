Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
