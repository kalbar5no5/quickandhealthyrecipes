Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
