Brush rectangles with melted butter and sprinkle with sugar mixture. These Cinnamon Rolls (Buns) are made with an enriched white yeast bread. They have a wonderfully soft and tender crumb and are filled with a mixture of ground cinnamon, brown sugar, and butter. In my family, giant, gooey cinnamon rolls are a staple for special occasion breakfasts. To me, a good cinnamon roll is made with a flavorful dough (butter and yeast, y&#39;all), a solid filling, and a killer. 

Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
