Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
