- "1 Chicken thighs any parts will do"
- "1 Japanese leek white part"
- "2 to 2 12 tablespoons  SugarA"
- "50 ml Soy sauceA"
- "40 ml MirinA"
- "20 ml SakeA"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the yakitori chicken base. If you are using storebought  negima (chicken and leek skewers) skip ahead to Step 6. Otherwise, cut the chicken into about 3 cm cubes."
- "Cut the Japanese leek into 3 cm pieces to match the amount of chicken pieces you prepared in Step 1."
- "Skewer the chicken and leek pieces alternately. This may be hard to do if you&#39;re not used to doing it. If so, go on and read Steps 4 and 5."
- "【How to skewer the chicken cleanly and easily】Arrange the chicken cubes from step 1 in one layer on a piece of cling film and it up. Put in the freezer for 40 minutes to 1 hour until partially frozen."
- "Take out the partially frozen chicken from the freezer, and skewer it. This method is unconventional, but this way it&#39;s really easy to skewer the chicken."
- "Heat the grill over a high heat. After 2 to 3 minutes turn the heat down to medium. Line up the negima skewers on the rack and grill."
- "After 5 to 7 minutes when the surfaces of the meat have gotten grill marks, flip them over. The skewers will be cooking a bit unevenly depending on where they are positioned on the rack, so change their positions around."
- "Put the A ingredients in a frying pan and bring to a boil. When it&#39;s bubbling, if the negima skewers aren&#39;t cooked yet,  turn the heat off under the frying pan and leave it for a while."
- "When the skewers from Step 7 have browned nicely, put them in the sauce from Step 8.  *Turn up the heat to a bit lower than high and reduce the sauce until almost all the liquid has evaporated."
- "【Note】This is common sense, but do not overcook the chicken. It will be become too tough."
- "【Note】Since the chicken skewers will be simmered in the frying pan, in Step 9 it should have grill marks on the outside, and cooked through about 80% inside for the best results."
- "The chicken skewers are delicious enough right after Step 9 is complete, but I like to quickly toast the skewers over a flame just before serving. If you don&#39;t have a gas burner you can wram them up over a grill or in a toaster oven."
- "Transfer to serving plates and it&#39;s done. People are always paying visits to our house all year round, and this is one of the most popular dishes that we serve."
- "I believe this sauce will suit all tastes. You can use it on any ingredients. Please enjoy yakitori your way."
- "Leftover sauce can be frozen. When you make yakitori the next time, just add more sauce if there&#39;s not enough."
- "【Attention】Grilling times vary depending on your grill. If you are making these for the first time, please check the heat levels. You can bake the skewers in an oven of course."
- "[Attention] If using a grill or toaster oven to toast the skewers in Step 12, it&#39;s very easy to burn them so please be sure to watch them carefully."

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
