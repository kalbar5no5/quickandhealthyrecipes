Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine.
