How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
