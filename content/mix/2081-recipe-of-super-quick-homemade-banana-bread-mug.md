Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
