Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
