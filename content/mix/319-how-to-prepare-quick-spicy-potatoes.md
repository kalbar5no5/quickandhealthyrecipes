Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
