Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
