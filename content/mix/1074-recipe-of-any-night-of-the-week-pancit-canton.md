Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
