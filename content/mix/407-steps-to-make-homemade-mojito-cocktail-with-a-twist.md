Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
