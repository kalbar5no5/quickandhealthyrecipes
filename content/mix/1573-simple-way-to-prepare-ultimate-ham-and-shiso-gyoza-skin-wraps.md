How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
