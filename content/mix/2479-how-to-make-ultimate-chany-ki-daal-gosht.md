Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
