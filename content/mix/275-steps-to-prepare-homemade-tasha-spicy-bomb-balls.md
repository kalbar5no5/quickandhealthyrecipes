Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
