Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
