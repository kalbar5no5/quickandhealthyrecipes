Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
