Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
