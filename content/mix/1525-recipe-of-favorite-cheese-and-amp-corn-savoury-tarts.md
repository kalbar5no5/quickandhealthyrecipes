Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
