Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
