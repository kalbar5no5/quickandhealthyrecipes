##### The ingredients needed to make Macrobiotic Oden Made Simple with a Rice Cooker:

1. Prepare 1/3 Daikon radish
1. Take 2 large Potatoes
1. Prepare 4 Kombu (tied and soaked in water to extract the dashi stock)
1. Prepare 1 packet Shirataki noodles
1. Make ready 1/2 Carrot

If you prepare rice to serve with Oden, preserve the white water from cleaning rice. Put daikon and the white water in a small pot and start cooking until a skewer goes through (do not cover the lid). In Japan, we say the rice water will get rid of bitterness and bad smell from daikon and the water also makes daikon beautiful white color. Oden is conceptually very simple but given the huge variety of ingredients you can use, no one pot of Oden is the same.

In Japan, we say the rice water will get rid of bitterness and bad smell from daikon and the water also makes daikon beautiful white color. Oden is conceptually very simple but given the huge variety of ingredients you can use, no one pot of Oden is the same. Although some items are almost de rigueur (Oden just isn&#39;t complete without boiled egg and daikon IMHO) others may simply be personal favourites or regional specialties. In a separate bowl mix the rice syrup, barley malt, and maple syrup together. Pour over top of the sweet potatoes, replace lid, and continue to cook until the potatoes are tender. 

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
