Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
