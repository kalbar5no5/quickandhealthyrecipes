Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
