At this point they can be placed on waxed paper and refrigerated until ready to cook. If you like your curry runny, you could skip the coconut cream.

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
