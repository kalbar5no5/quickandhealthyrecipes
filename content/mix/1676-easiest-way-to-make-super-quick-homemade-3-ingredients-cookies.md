Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
