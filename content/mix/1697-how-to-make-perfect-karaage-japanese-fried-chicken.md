Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
