Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
