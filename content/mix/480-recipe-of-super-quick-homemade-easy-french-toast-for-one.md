recipeingredient:
- "2 eggs"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1/2 tsp cinnamon"
- "1/3 cup milk"
- "4 stale or day old bread  any kind"
- "dash salt"
- "1/2 tsp nutmeg"
- "2 tbsp white granulated sugar"
- " Butter for browning or cooking spray"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a flat bottom dish (I use a pie plate - holds 2 slices bread), beat the eggs with the milk. Add remaining ingredients until well blended."
- "Dip the bread in the egg/milk mix. Make sure both sides are well coated. Don&#39;t soak too long, though."
- "Lightly grease a griddle or fry pan with either spray or butter. About medium high is good. Brown the bread for about 2 mins then turn and brown the other side. Don&#39;t cook too fast, as the outside will brown and you will have uncooked &#34;custard&#34; on the inside. Your toast will also fall apart."
- "When toast is done, you can add fruit toppings, sprinkle with powdered sugar or serve with butter and maple syrup. I like the taste of vanilla, you can always increase or decrease as well as the cinnamon and nutmeg. These freeze well. Double the recipe and when they are cool wrap them up and freeze for another meal. Just heat them in the toaster or toaster oven."

Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
