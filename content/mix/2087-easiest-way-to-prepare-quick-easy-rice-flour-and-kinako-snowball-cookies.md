A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk.

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
