Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
