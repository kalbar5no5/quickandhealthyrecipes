Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
