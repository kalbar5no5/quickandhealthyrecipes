Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
