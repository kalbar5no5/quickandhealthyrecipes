Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
