I am literally obsessed with how this came out! First let&#39;s take a quick look at the origin of red velvet cake so we can clear up the fact that it never really had red dye to begin with, but over the years and our &#34;need&#34; for aesthetics before anything, we started adding tons of red dye to the cake better for a thrilling red that. Red velvet cake and its original recipe are well known in the United States. The name is believed to come from the sugar of the time, combined with the unprocessed cocoa powder, that created a lovely red hue.

Red velvet cake and its original recipe are well known in the United States. The name is believed to come from the sugar of the time, combined with the unprocessed cocoa powder, that created a lovely red hue. Traditionally, the cake was iced with a very light and fluffy French-style butter roux icing (also called ermine icing). Oreo chocolate tart with fruit puree. Once cooked well, allow it to cool and then puree the beetroot in a mixer grinder. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
