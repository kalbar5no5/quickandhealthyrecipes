Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
