Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
