Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
