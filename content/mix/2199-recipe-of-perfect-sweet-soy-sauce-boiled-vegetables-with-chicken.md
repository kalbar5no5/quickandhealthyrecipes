Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
