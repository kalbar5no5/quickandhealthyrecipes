Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
