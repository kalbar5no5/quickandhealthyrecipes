How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
