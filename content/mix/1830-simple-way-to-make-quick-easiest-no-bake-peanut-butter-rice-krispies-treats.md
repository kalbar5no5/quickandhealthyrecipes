Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
