Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
