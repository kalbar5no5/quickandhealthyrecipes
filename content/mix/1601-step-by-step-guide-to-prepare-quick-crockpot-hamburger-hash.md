Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
