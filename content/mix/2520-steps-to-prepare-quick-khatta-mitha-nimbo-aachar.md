Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
