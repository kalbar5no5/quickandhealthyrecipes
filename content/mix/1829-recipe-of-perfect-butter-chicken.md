Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
