How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
