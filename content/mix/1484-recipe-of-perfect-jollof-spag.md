Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
