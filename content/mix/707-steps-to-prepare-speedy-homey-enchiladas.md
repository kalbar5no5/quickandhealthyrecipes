Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
