- "1 TBS sugar or 1 tsp of honey"

- " garnish"
- " sesami seeds"

recipeinstructions:
- "Boil plenty of water in a kettle."
- "Pour boiling water onto frozen or fresh chicken wings from the kettle. Drain the water well. If you are using frozen chicken wings, you could defrost them beforehand, but you could do it directly from frozen. Please dip them in hot water for a few minutes rather than just pour. Then, you could separate them if they are sticking together etc. Drain them well.   You could also season the chicken wings here with pepper but you sprinkle black pepper at the end, so you could omit the seasoning here."
- "Put some cornflour into a plastic bag and put chicken wings. Then shake them well."
- "Please lay a sheet of cooking parchment in the air fryer or on a baking tray if you using an oven. It will collect oil from the chicken and will make chicken crispier when they were turned over."
- "Put the chicken wings in an air fryer and cook with 180 degrees for about 18-30 mins depends on the sizes of the chicken wings and whether they are frozen or fresh. In the middle of cooking, please turn over at least twice.  If you do not have an air fryer, please cook them in an oven with around 220℃ degree for about 18-30 mins. Or deep fry them in a pan. When frying, please fry them twice."
- "While cooking the chicken wings, make the sticky sauce. Put all sauce ingredients (soy sauce, Mirin, sugar and Sake) into a saucepan and simmer until thickened. Or put them into a microwavable bowl and heat until become thickened. Stop, stir and check at least every 2 mins. Once it becomes a bit thickened, check and stir every 30 seconds to 1 min, depends on your microwave. I prefer use 600 w (medium setting on my microwave). Each interval, please check and stir."
- "Dip the cooked chicken wings into the sauce while they are really hot. Preferably, you could hear sizzling sounds when you dip them into the sauce. Then, sprinkle sesame seeds and some black pepper. It is ready to serve.  It looks and tastes salty but the sauce is only outside. So actually, the amount of salt is not so much in this dish."
- "These are soy sauce, Mirin and Sake that I used for this dish. You could use Pale Sherry instead of Sake (Japanese rice wine). It used to very difficult for me to get Sake, so I always used Pale Sherry instead. But nowadays, you could get a cooking Sake or Sake from supermarkets!"

Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
