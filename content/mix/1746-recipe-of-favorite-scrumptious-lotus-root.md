Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
