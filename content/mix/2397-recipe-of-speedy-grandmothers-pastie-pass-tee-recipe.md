Fill the now-empty tomato paste can with water and add it to the dish. Recipe developer Katie Webster&#39;s grandmother used to make a version of this dish with fresh-caught smallmouth bass from Vermont&#39;s Lake Champlain. Our updated version requires no fishing; just a trip to the supermarket for Pacific cod or tilapia. Grandma likely didn&#39;t take any shortcuts when cooking, but that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t make your life a bit easier. Start with store-bought pie crust to guarantee this fuss-free dinner is on the. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
