Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
