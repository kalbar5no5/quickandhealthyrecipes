Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
