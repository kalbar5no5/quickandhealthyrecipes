Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
