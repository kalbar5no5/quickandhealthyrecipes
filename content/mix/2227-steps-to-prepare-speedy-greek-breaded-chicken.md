Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
