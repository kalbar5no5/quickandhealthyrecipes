Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
