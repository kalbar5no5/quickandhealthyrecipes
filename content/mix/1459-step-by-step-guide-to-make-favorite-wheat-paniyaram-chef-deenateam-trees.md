Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
