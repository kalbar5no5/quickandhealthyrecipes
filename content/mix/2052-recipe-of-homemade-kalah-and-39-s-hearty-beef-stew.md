Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
