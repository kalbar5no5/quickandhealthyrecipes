Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
