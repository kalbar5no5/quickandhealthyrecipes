Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
