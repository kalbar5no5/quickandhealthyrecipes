Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood.

Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them.
