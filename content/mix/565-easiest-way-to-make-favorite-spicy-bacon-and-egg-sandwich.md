Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
