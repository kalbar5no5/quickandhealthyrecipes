Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine.
