Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
