How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
