Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
