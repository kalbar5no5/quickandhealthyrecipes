Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
