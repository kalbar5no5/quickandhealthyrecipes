Crisp yet tender with bursts of sweet and savory flavors, Kinpira Renkon, or Japanese Lotus Root Stir Fry, is a classic home-cooked side dish. One of the reasons I love about Japanese home-cooked meals is that root vegetables are used in a whole range of dishes. From gobo (burdock root), renkon (lotus root), satoimo (taro root), daikon radish. In a medium sauce pan, mix together coconut aminos or soy sauce, sugar, arrowroot, ginger, lime juice, and garlic and simmer and cool.

Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
