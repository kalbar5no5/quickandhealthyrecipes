Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
