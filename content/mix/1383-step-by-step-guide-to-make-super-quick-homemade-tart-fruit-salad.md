Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
