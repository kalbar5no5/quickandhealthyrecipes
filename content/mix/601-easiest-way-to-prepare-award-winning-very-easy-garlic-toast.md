Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine.

You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
