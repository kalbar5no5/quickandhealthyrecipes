Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
