How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
