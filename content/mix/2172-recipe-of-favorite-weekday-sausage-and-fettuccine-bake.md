How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
