Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
