Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
