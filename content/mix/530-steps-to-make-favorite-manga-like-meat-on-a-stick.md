Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!
