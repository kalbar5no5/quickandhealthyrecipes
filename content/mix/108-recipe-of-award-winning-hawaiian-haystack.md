How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!
