Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
