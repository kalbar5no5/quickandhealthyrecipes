Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
