Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
