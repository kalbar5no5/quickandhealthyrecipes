Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
