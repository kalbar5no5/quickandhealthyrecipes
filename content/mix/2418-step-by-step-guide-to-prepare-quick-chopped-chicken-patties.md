Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
