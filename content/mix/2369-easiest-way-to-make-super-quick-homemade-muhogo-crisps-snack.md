Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
