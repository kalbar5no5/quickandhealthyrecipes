Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
