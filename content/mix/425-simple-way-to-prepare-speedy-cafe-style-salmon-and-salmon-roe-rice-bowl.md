Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
