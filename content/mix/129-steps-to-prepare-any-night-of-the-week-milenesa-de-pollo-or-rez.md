Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
