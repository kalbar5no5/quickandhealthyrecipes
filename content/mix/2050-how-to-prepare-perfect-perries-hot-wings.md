Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
