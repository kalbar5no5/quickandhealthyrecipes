How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
