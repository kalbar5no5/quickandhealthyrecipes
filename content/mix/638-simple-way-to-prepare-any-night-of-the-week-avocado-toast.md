Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
