Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
