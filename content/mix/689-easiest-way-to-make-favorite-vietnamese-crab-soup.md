Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
