Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
