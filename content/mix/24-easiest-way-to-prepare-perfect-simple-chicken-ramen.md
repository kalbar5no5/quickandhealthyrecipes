Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
