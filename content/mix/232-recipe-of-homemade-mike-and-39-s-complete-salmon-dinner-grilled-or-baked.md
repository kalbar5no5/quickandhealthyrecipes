Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
