Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
