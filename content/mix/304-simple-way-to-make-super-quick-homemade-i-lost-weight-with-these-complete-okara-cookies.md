Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
