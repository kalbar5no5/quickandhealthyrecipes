Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
