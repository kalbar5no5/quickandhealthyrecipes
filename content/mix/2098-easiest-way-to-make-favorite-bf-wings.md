How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
