Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
