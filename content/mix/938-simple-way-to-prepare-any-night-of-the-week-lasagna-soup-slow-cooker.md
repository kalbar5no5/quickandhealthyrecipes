Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
