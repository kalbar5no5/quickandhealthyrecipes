Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
