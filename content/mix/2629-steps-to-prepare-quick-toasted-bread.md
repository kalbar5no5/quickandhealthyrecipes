Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
