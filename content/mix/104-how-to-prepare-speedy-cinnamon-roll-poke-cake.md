How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
