Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
