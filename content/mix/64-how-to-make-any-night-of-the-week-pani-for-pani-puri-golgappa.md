Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
