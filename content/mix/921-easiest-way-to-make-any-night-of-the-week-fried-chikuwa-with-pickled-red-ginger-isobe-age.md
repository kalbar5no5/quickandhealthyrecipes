Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
