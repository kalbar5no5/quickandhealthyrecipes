How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
