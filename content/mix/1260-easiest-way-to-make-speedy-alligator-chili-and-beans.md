Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at battling depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
