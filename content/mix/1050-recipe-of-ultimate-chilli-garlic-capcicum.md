Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
