Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
