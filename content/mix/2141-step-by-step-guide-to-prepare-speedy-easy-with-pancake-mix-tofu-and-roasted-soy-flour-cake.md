Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
