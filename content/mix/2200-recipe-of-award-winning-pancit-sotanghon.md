I love to have this with few pieces of lumpiang shanghai dipped in homemade sweet and sour sauce. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook the chicken, skimming off any foam that forms. This was the first pancit recipe I tried and I loved it. I made it again using a different recipe (I couldn&#39;t find this one again), and it wasn&#39;t nearly as good. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
