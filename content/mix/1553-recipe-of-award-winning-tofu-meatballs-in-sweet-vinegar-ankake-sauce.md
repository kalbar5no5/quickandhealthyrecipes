Great recipe for Okara Tofu Meatballs with a Sweet Vinegar Sauce. To make these a bit more healthy, I added okara! When the sweet vinegar sauce is freshly made, it has a sharp taste, but after it has settled for some time, it becomes quite mellow and just right! In a wok add all the ingredients for the sweet and sour ankake sauce, except the katakuriko starch powder.

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
