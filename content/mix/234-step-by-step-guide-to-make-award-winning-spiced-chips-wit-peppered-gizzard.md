Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
