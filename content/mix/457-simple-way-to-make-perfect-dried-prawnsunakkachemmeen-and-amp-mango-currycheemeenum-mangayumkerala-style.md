Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
