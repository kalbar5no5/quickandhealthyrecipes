How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
