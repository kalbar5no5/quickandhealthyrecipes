Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
