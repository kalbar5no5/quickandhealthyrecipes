Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
