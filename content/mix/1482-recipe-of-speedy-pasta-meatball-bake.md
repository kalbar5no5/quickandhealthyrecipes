Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
