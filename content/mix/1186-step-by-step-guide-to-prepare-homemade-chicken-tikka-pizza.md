Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
