Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
