Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
