Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
