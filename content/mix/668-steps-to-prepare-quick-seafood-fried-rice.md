Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!
