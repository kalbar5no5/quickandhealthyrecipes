Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
