Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
