Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
