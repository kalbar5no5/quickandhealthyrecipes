Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
