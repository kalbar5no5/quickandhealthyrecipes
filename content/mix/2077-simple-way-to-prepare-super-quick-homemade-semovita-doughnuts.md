Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
