Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
