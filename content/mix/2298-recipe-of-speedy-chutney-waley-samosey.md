Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
