Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
