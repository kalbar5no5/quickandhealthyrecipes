Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at combating depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
