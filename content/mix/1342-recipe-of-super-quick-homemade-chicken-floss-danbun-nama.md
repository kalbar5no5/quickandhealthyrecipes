Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
