Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
