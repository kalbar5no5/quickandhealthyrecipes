Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
