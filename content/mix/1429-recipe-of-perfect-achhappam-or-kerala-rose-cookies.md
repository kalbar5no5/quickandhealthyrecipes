- "Dip the achappam mould in the hot oil first and then dip it in the batter but it should be noted here that the mould should not be dipped fully but only 1/4 th of it should be dipped in the batter."
- "Now lift this up and place it in the kadahi for frying them. The achappams will get detached from the mould in a few seconds. Otherwise give the mould a slight tap. They will be detached easily. Now fry these on low to medium flame only so that they get cooked evenly."
- "Repeat all in the same fashion and after the batter gets over, take the other bowl with half of the batter. At first they will look soft to touch but as they cool down, the achappams will be crunchy and crispy. After they cool down thoroughly, store them in airtight containers and relish upto 15 days."
- "The achappam mould will work fine if it is an old one and has been used many a times but if it is new one, do not worry, clean it with soap and water, dry it well and then place it dipped in hot oil for a few minutes before using. This is called seasoning of the mould. After you do this, it will work just fine. So do not panic."

Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
