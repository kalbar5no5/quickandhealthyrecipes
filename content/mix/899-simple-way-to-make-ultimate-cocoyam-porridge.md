Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
