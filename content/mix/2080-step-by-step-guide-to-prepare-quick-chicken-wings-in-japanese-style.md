Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
