How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
