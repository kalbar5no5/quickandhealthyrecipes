Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
