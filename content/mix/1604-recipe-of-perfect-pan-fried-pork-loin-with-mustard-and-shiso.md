Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
