Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
