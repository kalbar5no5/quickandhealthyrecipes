Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
