Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
