Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
