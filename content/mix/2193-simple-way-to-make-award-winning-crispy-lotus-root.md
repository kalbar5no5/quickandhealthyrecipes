Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
