Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
