Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
