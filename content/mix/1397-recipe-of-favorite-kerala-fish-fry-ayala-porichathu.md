Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
