Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
