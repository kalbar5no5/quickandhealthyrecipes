The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood.

They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible!
