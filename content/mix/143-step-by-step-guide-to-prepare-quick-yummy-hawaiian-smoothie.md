Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
