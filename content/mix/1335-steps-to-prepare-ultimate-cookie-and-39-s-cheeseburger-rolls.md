Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
