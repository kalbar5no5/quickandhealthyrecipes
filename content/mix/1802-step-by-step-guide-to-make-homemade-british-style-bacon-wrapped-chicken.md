At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better.
