Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
