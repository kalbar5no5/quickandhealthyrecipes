Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
