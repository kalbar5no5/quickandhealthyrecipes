Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
