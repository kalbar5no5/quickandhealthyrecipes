Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
