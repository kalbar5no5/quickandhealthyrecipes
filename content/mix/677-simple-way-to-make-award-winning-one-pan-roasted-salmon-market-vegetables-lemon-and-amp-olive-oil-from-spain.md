Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
