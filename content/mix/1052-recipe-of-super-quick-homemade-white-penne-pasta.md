How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
