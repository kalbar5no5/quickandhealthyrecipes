How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
