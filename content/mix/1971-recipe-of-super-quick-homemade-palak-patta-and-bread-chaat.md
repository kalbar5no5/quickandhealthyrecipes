Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
