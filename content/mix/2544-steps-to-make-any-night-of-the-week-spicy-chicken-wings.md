How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
