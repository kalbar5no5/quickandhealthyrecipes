Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
