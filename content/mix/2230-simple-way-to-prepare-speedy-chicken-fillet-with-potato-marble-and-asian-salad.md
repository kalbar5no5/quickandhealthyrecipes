Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
