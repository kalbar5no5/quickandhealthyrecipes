Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
