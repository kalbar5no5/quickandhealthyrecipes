Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
