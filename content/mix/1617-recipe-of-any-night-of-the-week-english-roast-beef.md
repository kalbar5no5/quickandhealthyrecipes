Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
