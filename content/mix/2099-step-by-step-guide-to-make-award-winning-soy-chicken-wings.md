Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!
