Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
