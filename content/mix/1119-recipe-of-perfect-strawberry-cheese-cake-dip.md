Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
