Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
