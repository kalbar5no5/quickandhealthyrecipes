Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
