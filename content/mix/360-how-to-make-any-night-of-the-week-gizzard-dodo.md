Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
