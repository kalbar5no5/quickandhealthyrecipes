Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood.

Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.
