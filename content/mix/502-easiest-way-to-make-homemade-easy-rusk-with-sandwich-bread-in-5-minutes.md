Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
