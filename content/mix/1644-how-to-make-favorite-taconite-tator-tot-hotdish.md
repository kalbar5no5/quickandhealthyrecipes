Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
