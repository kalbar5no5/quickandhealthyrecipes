Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
