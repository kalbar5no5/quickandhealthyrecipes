Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
