Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
