It&#39;s an Indian style sauce - outrageously addictive, and pairs beautifully with chicken, vegetables and legumes. Low-cal, low-carb, and HEALTHY but tastes like comfort food!! A few months ago I made Sweet Potato and Chickpea Coconut Curry and since then have fallen in love with all things Thai curry. Saute broccoli (and onion/garlic if you&#39;re using it) in a tablespoon of oil. The broccoli should soften but still be tender-crisp. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
