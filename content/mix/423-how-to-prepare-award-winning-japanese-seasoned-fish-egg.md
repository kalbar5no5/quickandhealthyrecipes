Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
