Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
