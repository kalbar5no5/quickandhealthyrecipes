Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
