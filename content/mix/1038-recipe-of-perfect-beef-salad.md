Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!
