Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
