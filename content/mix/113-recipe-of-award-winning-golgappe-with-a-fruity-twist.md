Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
