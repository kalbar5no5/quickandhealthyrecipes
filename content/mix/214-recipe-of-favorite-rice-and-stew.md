Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!
