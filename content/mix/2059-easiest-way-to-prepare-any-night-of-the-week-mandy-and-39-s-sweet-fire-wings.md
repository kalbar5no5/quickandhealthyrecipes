Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
