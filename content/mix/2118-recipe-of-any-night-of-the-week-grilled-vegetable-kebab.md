Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
