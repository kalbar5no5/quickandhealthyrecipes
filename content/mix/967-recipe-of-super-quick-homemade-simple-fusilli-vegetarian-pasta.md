Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
