Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
