Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
