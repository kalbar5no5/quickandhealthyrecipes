Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
