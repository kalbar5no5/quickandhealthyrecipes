recipeinstructions:
- "These are the ingredients. Oops... I forgot to put the black sesame seeds in the picture. My bad."
- "You can use the butter at room temp or you can cover it with plastic wrap and heat up in the microwave for 30~40 seconds at 600 W. This makes it soft. (If you go the microwave route, be careful not to melt it too much)"
- "Cream the butter."
- "Divide the raw cane sugar into halves or thirds and add, mixing each time you add a portion in."
- "Once the sugar has been mixed in well, add in the egg yolk and mix well."
- "It&#39;s well mixed."
- "Sift in the flour."
- "Using a rubber spatula, mix it in cutting motions."
- "Mix it until it looks smooth and crumbly like this picture."
- "Divide the dough in half and add the red food coloring to one half. When you pour it in, use a toothpick, so that you don&#39;t accidentally add too much."
- "Mix it with a cutting motion until the dough comes together and the color is well distributed."
- "Take the other half of the dough that you separated and take 1/3 of it out. Mix the 1/3 with matcha powder till it turns green."
- "The three colored doughs are done!"
- "Roll the red dough up into a rolling pin-like shape. Next, roll up the dough with parchment paper instead of plastic wrap. It&#39;s easier to roll it up this way."
- "By using two rulers, you can form the dough into a strawberry shape. If you don&#39;t have rulers, you can do this with plastic wrap and an aluminum foil box instead."
- "Let it rest in the freezer for 10 minutes. Chilling it will make it easier to handle. As shown in the picture, use a kitchen knife to cut two lines in the dough diagonally."
- "If it&#39;s still diffcult to handle, put back in the fridge for another 5 minutes, then cut 3 slits lenghwise in the dough."
- "Cut the matcha dough into 3 long slices."
- "Put the strips of green dough into the slits cut in the red dough."
- "Roll it up in some parchment paper."
- "Now it looks like a strawberry!"
- "Take the regular dough now and roll it out. Place the strawberry dough on top and roll it up."
- "Roll it up in some parchment paper."
- "Chill in the freezer for 20 minutes. If you have time, try to let it chill for 30 minutes. It makes it easier to cut."
- "Cut the dough into 4 mm wide cookies. Preheat your oven to 180℃."
- "Arrange them on a metal tray and then decorate with the black sesame seeds. Dip a chopstick in water, and then dip it in the bowl of black sesame seeds to pick up individual seeds. It&#39;s easier to decorate this way."
- "Bake them at 180℃ for 17~20 minutes. Adjust the baking time based on your oven."
- "After they have baked for about 8 minutes, take them out and if they look like the picture, cover with some aluminum foil. This prevents them from overcooking."
- "Since you&#39;ve gone to all the trouble of making them look like strawberries, be sure to use aluminum foil! Once they have reached a good color, take them out of the oven."
- "Finished. They&#39;re so cute! The texture is crispy, and just a bit moist."
- "Refreshing. How about some orange freezer cookies?  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/147343-refreshing-orange-icebox-cookies"

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
