Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.
