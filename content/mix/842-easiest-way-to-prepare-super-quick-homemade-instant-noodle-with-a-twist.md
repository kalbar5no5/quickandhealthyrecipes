Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
