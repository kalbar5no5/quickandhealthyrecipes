Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
