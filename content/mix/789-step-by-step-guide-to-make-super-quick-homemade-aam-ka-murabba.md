Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
