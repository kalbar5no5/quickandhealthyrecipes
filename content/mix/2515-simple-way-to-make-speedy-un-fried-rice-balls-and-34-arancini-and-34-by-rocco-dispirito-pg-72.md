Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
