Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
