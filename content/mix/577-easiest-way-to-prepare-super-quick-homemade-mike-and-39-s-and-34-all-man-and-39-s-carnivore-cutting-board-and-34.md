Give him a choice. Trust me. He won&#39;t want to take the time to fetch a knife and slice his own butter. Apparently big boys off duty can tend to be pretty damned lazy."
- "No utensils are needed whatsoever. Let your man tear his own bread, dip it in the room temperature butters you&#39;ll provide and, let him eat his meat, cheeses and bread by hand. By the way, here&#39;s a great, easy recipe for Honey Butter. Go ahead. Give him a slighter sweeter option.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/364116-mikes-french-honey-butter-spread"
- "If you really want to impress him - have his favorite beers chilled on crushed ice right next to his meats, cheeses, butter and bread. Napkins aren&#39;t required since I understand men sincerely believe that&#39;s exactly what the good Lord gave them a lower arm for."
- "Feel free to add a myriad of additional sliced meats, sliced cheeses and crackers to this cutting board. Remember, you&#39;re the boss here! Not him. But, it IS okay to make him think he is. Big dummies. ðŸ˜†"

Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
