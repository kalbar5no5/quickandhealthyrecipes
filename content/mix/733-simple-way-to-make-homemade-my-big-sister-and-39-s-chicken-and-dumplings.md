Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
