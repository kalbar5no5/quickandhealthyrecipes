Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
