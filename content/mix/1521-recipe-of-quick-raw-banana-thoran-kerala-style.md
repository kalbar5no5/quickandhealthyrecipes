Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!
