Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
