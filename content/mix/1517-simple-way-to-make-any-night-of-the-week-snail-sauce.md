How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
