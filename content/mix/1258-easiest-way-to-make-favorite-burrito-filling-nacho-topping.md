The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood.

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest.
