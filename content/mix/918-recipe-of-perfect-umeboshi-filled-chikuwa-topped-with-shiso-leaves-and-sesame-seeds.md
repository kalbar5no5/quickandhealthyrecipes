Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
