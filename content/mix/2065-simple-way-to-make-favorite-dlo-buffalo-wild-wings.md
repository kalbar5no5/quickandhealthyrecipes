Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
