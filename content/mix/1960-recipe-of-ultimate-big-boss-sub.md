Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
