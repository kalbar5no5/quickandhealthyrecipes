Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
