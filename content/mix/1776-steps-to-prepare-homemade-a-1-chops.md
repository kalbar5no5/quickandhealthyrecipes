Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
