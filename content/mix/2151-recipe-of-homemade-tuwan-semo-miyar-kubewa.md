Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
