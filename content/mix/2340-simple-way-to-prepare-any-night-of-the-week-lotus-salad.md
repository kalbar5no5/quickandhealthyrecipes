How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
