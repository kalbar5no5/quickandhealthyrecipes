Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
