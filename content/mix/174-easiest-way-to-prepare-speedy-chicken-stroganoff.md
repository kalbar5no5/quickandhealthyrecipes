Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
