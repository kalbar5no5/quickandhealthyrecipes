Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
