Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
