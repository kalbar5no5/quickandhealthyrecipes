Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
