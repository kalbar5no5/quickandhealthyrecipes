Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
