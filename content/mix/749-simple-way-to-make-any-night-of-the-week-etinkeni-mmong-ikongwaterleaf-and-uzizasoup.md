Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
