Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
