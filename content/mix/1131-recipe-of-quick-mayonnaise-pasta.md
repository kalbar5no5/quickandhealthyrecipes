Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
