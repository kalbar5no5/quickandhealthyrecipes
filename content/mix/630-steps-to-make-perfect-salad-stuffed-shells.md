Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
