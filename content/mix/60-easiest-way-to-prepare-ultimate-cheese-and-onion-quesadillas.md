Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
