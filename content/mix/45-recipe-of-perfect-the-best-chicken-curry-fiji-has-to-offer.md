How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
