Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
