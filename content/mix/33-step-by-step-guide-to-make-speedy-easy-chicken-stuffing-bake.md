Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
