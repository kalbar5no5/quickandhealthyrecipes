Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
