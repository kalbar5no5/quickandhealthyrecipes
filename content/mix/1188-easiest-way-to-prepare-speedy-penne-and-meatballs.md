Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
