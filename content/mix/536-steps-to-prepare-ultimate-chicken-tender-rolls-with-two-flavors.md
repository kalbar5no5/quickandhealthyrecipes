Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
