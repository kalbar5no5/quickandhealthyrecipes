Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
