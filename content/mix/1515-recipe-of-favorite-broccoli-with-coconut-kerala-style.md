Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
