Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
