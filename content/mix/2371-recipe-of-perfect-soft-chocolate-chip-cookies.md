Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
