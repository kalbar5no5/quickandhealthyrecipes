How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
