Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
