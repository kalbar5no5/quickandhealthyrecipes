Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
