- "This sausage bread can be made in bulk because it freezes so well. If you choose to freeze them, be sure to let the rolls to come to room temperature. Put them in a Ziploc or tightly sealed plastic bag and store in the freezer. You need to let them thaw before warming them. You can place them in the oven to warm up or microwave for a minute or two.

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
