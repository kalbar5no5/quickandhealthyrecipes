How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
