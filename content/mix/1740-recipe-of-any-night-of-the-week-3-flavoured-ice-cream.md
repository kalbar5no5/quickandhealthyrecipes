Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
