Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
