- "Gather all of your fresh vegetables and chop those vegetables that need to be. If you&#39;re opting for the ingredients in the Options section - add them at the same time as the rest of your ingredients. Except for your fresh oysters. Add them just before you add your noodles."
- "Boil Ramen Noodles for 2 1/2 minutes. Drain. Evenly coat noodles lightly with Wok Oil and mix well to keep them from drying out. Place in a sealed container until you&#39;re ready for them.                                                                                               ● Tip: When draining your noodles in the sink - drain your water slowly. Otherwise, if you just dump quickly - the boiled water will seize up in the drain and force water back up from drain and hit your noodles. Yuck!"
- "Heat your Wok and add Wok Oil. Add your Red Pepper Flakes."
- "Add your vegetables to your high heated Wok and cook on high for 2 minutes. Also, add Oyster Sauce and Siracha. Stir regularly. You don&#39;t want to burn your garlic!"
- "Add your Ramen Noodles to your Wok and mix quickly until noodles are completely coated."
- "Serve immediately with sides of Siracha and Soy Sauce. Feel free to garnish this dish as you wish. Cilantro, Parsley, Jalapeños, boiled eggs and a wedges of lime all go great with this dish. Enjoy!"

Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
