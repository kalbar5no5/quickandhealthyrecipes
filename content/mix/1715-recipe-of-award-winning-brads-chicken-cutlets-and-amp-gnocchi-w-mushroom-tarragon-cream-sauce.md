Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
