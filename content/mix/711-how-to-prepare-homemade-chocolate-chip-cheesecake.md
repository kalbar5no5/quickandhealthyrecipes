Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
