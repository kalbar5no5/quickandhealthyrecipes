By Mommy&#39;s Home Cooking Put mayocoba beans into a large container with enough cool water to cover by several inches. For those of you who&#39;ve never tried drunken beans, they are basically just that — pinto beans simmered in dark Mexican beer, bacon, onions, a handful of seasonings, and topped with cilantro. Most of the alcohol from the beer boils out during cooking, and you&#39;re left with some seriously savory, soupy, and scrumptious frijoles. For a quick and easy drunken beans version, use canned pinto beans instead of dry. Cook bacon in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat until crispy, stirring occasionally. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
