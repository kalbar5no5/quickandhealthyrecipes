Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
