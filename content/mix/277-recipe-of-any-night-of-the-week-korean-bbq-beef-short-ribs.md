Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
