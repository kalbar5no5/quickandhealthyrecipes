Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
