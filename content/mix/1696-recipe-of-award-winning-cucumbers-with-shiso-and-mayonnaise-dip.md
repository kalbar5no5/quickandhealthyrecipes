Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
