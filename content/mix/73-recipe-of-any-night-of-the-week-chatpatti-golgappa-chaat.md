Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
