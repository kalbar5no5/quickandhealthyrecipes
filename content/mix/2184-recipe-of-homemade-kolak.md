Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
