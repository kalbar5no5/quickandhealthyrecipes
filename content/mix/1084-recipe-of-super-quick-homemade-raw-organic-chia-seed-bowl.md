Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
