Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
