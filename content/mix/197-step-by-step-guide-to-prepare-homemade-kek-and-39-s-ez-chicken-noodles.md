Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
