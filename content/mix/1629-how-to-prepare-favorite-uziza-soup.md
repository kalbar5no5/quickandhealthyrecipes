Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
