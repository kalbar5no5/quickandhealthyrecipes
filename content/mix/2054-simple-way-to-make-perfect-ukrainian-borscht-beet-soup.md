Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
