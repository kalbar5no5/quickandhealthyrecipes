The key for CRISPY Brussels Sprouts (and we all know the crispy golden bits are the BEST part!) is a very hot oven and the parmesan which melts into a crunchy golden crust. It&#39;s tempting to use more parmesan - but to be honest, there&#39;s not much point because there&#39;s only so much that sticks to the sprouts!

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
