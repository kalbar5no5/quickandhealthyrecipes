Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
