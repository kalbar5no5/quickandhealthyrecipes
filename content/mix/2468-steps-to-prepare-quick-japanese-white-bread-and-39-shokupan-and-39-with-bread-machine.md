Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
