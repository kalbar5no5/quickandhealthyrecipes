Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
