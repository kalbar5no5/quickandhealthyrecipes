Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
