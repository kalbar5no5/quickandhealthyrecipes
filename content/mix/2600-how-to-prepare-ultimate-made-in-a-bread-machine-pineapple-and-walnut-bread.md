Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
