Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
