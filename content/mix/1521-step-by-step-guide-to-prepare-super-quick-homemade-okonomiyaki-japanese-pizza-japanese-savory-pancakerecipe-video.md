Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
