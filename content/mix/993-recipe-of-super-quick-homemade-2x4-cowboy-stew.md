Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
