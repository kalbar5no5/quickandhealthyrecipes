Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
