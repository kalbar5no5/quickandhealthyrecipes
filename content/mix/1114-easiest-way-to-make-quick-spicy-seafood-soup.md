Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
