How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
