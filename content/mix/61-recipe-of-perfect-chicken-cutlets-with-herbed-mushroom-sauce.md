We love mushrooms in my house. We enjoy them so much that sometimes I just sauté a zillion. The chicken cutlets are then nestled in a brothy, slightly buttery mushroom sauce that&#39;s simply flavored with chopped green onions and garlic- two ingredients with mega flavor-boosting capacity. And of course, the star ingredient, sauteed mushrooms (don&#39;t use canned mushrooms here, you want the earthy flavors of fresh mushrooms in the sauce.) Directions. Mix cornstarch and milk until smooth. 

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
