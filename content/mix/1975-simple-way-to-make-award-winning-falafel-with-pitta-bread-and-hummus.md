Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
