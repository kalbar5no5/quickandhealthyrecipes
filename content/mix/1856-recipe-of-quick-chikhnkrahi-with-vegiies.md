Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
