Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
