Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
