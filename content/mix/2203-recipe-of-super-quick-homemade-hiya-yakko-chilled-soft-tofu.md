Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
