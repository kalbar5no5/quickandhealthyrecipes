Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
