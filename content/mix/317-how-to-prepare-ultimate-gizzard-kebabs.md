Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
