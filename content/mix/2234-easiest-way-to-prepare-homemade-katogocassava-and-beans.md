Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
