Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
