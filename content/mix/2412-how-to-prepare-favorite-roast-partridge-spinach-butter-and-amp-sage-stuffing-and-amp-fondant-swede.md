Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!
