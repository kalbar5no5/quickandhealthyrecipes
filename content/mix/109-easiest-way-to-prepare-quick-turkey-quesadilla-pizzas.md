Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
