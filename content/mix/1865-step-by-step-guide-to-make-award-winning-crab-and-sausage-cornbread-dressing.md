How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
