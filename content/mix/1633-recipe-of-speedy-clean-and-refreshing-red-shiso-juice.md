recipeingredient:
- "300 grams Red shiso leaves"
- "800 grams Sugar"
- "2 liter Water"
- "20 grams Citric acid"
- "400 ml or if using vinegar instead of citric acid"
recipeinstructions:
- "Red shiso leaves are sold in bunches when it&#39;s time to make umeboshi (salted ume plums). I bought a 300 g bag."
- "Rip the leaves off the stems, since we&#39;ll only be using the leaves. Wash the leaves very well in water, and drain into a colander."
- "Bring 2 liters of water to a boil in a large pot, add the red shiso leaves and simmer to extract their essence. When the leaves have lost their red color and turned green, the water will have turned purple. Simmer for about 5 minutes, and then either squeeze out the leaves and remove them, or strain the liquid through a sieve into another pot."
- "Return the strained liquid to the pot, add the sugar and dissolve. Turn off the heat and add the citric acid (or vinegar). When you mix it the liquid will turn a beautiful red."
- "Leave to cool, and store in the refrigerator. If you made too much you can freeze it. Dilute to taste."
- "Citric acid is sold at pharmacies. 50 grams costs about 400 yen."
- "Notes: I&#39;ve tried grain vinegar and apple cider vinegar as the vinegar. If you add a tiny bit of salt to the concentrate, you can drink it as a sports drink."

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
