Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
