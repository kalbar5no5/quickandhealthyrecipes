Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
