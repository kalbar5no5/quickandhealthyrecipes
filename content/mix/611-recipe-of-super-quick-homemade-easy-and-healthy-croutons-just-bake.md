Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
