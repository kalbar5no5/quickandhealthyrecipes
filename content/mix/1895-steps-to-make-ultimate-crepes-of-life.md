Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
