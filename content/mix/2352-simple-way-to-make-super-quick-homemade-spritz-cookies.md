How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
