Stir in lemon juice, lemon zest and spinach/arugula blend. Pat dry and season peeled and deveined shrimp on both sides. The only other change I made was the following: rather than dumping the pasta directly into the arugula, I removed the shrimp from my saute pan, added a bit more shrimp broth and cooked the pasta for about a minute in the shrimp-garlic sauce. The pasta absorbed most of the liquid and, when poured onto the arugula, sauced the dish perfectly.

Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
