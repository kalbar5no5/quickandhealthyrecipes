Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
