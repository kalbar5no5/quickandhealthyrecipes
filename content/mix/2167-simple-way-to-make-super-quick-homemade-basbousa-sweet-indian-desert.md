Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
