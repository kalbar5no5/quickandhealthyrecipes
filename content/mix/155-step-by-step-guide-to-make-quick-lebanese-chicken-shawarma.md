Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
