How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
