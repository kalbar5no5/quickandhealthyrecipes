Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
