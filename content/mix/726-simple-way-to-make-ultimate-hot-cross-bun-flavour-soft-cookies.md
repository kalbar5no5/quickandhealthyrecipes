Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
