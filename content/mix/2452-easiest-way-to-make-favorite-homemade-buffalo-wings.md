Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
