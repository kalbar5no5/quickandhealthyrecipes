Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
