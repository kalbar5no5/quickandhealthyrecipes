Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
