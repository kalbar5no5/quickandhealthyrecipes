Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
