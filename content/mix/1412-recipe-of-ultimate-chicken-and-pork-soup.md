Todd Coleman. instant white rice, cream of chicken soup, pork chops. ranch dressing, bone-in pork chops, cream of chicken soup. Substitute chicken for pork in this dish, if you prefer. Pink beans are similar to pinto beans, but smaller; if you can&#39;t find pink beans, substitute pintos. My family and I love this soup, never any leftovers. I have also used chicken breast instead of pork, still delicious! 

Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
