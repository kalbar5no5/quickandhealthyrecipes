Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body.
