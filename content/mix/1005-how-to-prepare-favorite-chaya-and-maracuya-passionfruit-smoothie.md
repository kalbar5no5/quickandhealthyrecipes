Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
