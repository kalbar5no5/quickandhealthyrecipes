Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
