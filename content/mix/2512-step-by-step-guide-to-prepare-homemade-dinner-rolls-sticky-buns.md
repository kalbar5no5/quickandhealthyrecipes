Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body.
