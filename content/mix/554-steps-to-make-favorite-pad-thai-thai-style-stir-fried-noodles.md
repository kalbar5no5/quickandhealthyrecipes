Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
