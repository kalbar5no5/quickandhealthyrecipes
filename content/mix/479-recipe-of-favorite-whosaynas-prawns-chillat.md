Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.
