Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
