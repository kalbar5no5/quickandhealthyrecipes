Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
