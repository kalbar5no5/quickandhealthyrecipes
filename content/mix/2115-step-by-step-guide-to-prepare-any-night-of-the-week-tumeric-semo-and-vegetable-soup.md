Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
