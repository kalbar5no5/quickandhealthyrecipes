Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
