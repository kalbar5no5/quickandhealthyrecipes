Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
