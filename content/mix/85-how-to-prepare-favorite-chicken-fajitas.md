Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
