Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
