Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
