Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
