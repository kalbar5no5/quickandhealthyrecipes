Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
