Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
