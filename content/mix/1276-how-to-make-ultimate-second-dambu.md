Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
