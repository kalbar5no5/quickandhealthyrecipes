Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
