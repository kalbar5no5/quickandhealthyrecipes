Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
