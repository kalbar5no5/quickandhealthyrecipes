How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
