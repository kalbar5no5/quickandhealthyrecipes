Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
