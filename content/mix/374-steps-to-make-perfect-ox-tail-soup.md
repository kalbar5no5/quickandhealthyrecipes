Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
