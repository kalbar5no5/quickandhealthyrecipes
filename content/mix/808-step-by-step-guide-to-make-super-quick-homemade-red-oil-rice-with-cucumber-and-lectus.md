How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
