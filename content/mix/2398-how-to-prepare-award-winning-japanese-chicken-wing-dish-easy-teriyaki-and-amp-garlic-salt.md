Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
