Olive oil, grape seed, avocado, walnut oil or coconut oil all work well. We love using coconut oil when roasting sweet potatoes or squash. When it comes to flavorings, I usually throw a generous teaspoon of dried herbs — herbs de Provence being my current favorite. 

Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
