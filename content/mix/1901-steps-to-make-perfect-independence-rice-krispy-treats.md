Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
