Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
