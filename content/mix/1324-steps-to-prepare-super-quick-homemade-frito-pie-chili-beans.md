Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels.

Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.
