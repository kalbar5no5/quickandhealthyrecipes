Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
