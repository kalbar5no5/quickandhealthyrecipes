Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
