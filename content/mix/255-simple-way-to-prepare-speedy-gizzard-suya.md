Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine.
