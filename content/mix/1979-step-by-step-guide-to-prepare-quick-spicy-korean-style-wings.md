Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
