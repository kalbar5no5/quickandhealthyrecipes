Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
