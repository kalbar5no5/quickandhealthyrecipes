For soft fruit, such as strawberry and banana, roll the. Im fairly decent with an oven, and had a real good apple pie recipe which was my go-to recipe for special occasions. This however - knocks it out of the park. 

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
