Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
