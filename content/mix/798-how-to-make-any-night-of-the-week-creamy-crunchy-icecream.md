Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
