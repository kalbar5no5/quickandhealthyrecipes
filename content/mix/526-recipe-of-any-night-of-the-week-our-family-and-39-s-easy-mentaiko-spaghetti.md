Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
