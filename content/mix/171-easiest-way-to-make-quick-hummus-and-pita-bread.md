Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
