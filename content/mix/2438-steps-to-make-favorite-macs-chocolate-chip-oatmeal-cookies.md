Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
