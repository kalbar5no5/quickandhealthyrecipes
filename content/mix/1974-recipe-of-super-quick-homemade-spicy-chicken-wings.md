Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
