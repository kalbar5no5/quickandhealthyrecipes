Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
