Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
