Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts.

These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest.
