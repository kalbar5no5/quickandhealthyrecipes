Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
