Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body.
