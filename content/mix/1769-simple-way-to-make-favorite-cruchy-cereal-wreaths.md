Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
