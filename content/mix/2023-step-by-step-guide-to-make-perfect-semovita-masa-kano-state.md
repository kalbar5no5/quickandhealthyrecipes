Semolina is a high-gluten flour made from hard durum wheat. It has a rather coarse texture, yellow color, and is high in gluten protein. The high gluten content means the flour is especially well suited for making pasta, but this flour is also a common ingredient in bread and baked goods as well as couscous.

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
