recipeingredient:
- "200 to 300 grams  Thinly sliced beef offcuts"
- "1 large Burdock root"
- "1 large Lotus root"
- "1 regular Carrot"
- "1 heaping tablespoon Grated ginger"
- "1/8 tsp Grated garlic"
- "1 to finish Green onion optional"
- " The flavoring ingredients"
- "3 tbsp Soy sauce"
- "3 tbsp  2 tablespoons Mirin"
- "2 heaping teaspoons Sugar light brown sugar preferred"
- "2 tbsp Sake"
- "1 dash Red chili pepper"
- "1 handful Toasted sesame seeds"
- " Oil for frying"
- "1 tbsp Sesame oil or vegetable oil"
- "1 small cube Beef fat"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the burdock root, lotus root and carrot into large slivers. Don&#39;t cut them up too small, since you want to enjoy their texture. Not too big, either, though!"
- "Cut the veggies in the direction of the grain (or fiber). This way they&#39;ll retain their texture when cooked."
- "Soak the cut up vegetables in water, changing it several times, to get rid of bitterness. Put a little vinegar in the soaking water. Parboil the cut-up veggies briefly."
- "Boil the burdock root for 30 seconds, then add the lotus root and cook for another 30 seconds (1 minute total for the burdock root, 30 seconds for the lotus root.) If you cook it for too long, you&#39;ll lose that crunchy texture."
- "You don&#39;t need to parboil the carrot, since it cooks quickly. Drain everything well. No need to soak in cold water again."
- "Pre-flavor the beef with 2 tablespoons of sake, 1 teaspoon of soy sauce and 1 teaspoon of mirin. Sake will make it tender, and pre-flavoring it makes the taste distinctive. Work the pre-flavoring ingredients in well with your hands."
- "Let&#39;s start stir-frying! Put a little oil in a pan with a small piece of beef fat. This makes cheap and lean beef tasty. If you&#39;re using a fatty part of beef, you don&#39;t need it."
- "If you put the meat in the pan before it&#39;s heated, you can separate the slices easily."
- "Let&#39;s cook over high heat now. Stir fry the beef properly, then add the rest of the ingredients. Stir it up well with a spatula."
- "Now we&#39;ll work fast! Stir fry for 2 minutes, add the sugar → sake → mirin. The sugar goes first."
- "When the moisture has evaporated and the sugar is kind of sticky, stir fry for another minute over high heat. When everything is shiny, add the soy sauce."
- "When everything is coated well with soy sauce, pour in the mirin and stir everything up from the bottom. Stir fry to evaporate the mirin. When everything&#39;s shiny, add sesame seeds and chili pepper."
- "Mix it all up and it&#39;s done. It goes well with rice. Great when cooled, too. You can use it for bentos, right?"
- "I made double the amount and turned half of it into &#34;Beef and burdock root rice.&#34; See."

Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
