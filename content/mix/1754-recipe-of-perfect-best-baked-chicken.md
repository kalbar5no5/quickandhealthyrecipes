Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
