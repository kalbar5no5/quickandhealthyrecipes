Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
