Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
