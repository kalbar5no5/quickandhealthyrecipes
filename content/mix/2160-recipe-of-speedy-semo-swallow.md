Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
