How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
