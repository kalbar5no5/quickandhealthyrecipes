Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
