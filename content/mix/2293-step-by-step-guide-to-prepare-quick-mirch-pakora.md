Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
