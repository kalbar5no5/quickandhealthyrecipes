Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
