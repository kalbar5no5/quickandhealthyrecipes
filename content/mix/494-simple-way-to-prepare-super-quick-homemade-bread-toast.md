Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
