Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
