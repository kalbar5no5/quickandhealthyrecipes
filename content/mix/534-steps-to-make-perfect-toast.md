Toast gives your restaurant the technology you need to succeed in today&#39;s fast-paced environment. I added all of the spices as suggested and enjoyed the taste, although I would probably use less nutmeg next time. I used the rest of a loaf of french bread that we had bought the night before, so that made it extra tastey. I also followed another reviewer&#39;s suggestion and covered the pan with a lid so the middle. Voted best breakfast and open for lunch and dinner. 

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
