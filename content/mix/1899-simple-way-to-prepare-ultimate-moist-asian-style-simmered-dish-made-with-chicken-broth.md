Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
