Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
