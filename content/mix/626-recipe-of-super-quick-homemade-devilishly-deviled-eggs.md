Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
