Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
