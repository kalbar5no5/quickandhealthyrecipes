It is a dump and go kind of chili and uses only one pot to make. It is so simple and has SO much flavor.

In my opinion, the best chili recipe is a base of ground beef, tomato, spices, and BEANS. I love the number of fiber beans add to this dish and I promise you won&#39;t regret adding them. 

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
