Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
