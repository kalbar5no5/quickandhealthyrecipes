Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
