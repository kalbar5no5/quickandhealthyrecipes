Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
