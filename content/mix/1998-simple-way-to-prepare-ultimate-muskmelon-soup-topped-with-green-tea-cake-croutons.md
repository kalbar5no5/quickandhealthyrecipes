Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
