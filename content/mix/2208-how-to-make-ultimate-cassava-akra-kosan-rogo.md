Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
