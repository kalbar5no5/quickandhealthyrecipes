Pour batter into the prepared pan (s) and smooth out the top. This No-Bake Mango Cheesecake is probably the easiest cheesecake I&#39;ve done. It is very mildly sweetened to highlight the natural sweetness of the fresh mangoes and tartness of cream cheese. 

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
