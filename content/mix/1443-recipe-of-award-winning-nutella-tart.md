Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
