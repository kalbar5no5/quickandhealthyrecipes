Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
