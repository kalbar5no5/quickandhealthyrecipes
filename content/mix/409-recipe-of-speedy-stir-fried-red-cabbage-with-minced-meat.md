Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
