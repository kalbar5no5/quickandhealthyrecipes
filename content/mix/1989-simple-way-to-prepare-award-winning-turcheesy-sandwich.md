Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
