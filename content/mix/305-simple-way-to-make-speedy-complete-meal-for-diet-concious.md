Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
