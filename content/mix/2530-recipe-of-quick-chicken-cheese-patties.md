How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
