Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
