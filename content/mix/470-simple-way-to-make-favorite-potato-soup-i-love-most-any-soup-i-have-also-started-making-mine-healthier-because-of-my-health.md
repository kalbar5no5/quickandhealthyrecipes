Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
