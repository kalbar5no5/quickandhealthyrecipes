Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
