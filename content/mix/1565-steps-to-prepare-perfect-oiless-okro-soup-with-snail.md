Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
