Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
