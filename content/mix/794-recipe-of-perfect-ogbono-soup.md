Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!
