Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
