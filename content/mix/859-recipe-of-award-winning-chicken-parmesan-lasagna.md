Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
