Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
