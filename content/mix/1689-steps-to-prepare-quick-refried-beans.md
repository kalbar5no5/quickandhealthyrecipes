Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
