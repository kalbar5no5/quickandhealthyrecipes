Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
