Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
