Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
