How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
