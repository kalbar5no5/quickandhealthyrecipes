Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!
