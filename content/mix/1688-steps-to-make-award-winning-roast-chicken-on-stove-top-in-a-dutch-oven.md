Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
