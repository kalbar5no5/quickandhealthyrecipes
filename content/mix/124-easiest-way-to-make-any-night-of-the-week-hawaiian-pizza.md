Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
