How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
