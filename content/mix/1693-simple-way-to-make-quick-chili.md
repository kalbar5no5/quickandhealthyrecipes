It is a dump and go kind of chili and uses only one pot to make. It is so simple and has SO much flavor. Classic Chili Ingredients There&#39;s a big debacle on the internet whether classic chili has beans or no beans. In my opinion, the best chili recipe is a base of ground beef, tomato, spices, and BEANS. I love the number of fiber beans add to this dish and I promise you won&#39;t regret adding them. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
