Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
