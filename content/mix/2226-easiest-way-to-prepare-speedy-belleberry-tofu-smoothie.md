Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
