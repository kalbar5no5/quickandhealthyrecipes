Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
