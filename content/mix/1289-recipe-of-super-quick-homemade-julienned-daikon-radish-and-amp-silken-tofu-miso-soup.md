Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
