Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
