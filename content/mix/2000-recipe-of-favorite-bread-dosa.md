Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
