Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
