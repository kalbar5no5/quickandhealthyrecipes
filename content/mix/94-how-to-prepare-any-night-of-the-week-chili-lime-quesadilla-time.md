Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
