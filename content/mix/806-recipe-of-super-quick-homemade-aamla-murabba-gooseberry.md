Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
