Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
