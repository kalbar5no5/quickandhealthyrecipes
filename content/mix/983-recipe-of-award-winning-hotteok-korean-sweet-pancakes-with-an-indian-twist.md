recipeingredient:
- "2 cups Allpurpose Flour or Maida"
- "2 tsp Yeast"
- "2 tsp Sugar"
- "1 1/2 cup lukewarm water"
- " FOR THE KHEER"
- "1 litre Milk"
- "2 tbsp Milk powder"
- "1/4 cup Rice soaked dried and ground"
- "50 gm Fresh Cream"
- "1/2 tsp Cardamom powder"
- "1/4 cup Almonds Pistachios and Cashewnuts slivered"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put lukewarm water in a mixing bowl and add sugar and yeast followed by dough. Mix it well."
- "Let the dough rise. For this, it should sit with a closed lid for about an hour at room temperature. Once it is done, mix well."
- "The dough should be thick enough just like a pancake batter. Make sure that it&#39;s not like any ordinary roti flour. This step is really very important. It should be of a pouring consistency."
- "In a non-stick pot, put in the milk. Take milk powder and mix it well with as little water as possible. Once the milk starts boiling and has been reduced to 3/4th of it&#39;s original quantity, put in all the other ingredients except the nuts."
- "Keep stirring the kheer on a high heat until it becomes thick. The kheer should be quite thick as we&#39;ll be using this as a filling. Garnish well with the nuts."
- "In a heated pan on a low, drizzle a teaspoon of oil. With the help of a spoon, put in a small portion of the fermented batter to make a nice small pancake."
- "Wait for 2-3 minutes or until the pancake looks like it&#39;s starting to get cooked. An important point to remember is that these should be cooked on a low heat. At this point, put some kheer on the pancake."
- "Cover with a lid and wait for a few seconds. Next is to top the kheer with another layer of pancake batter. Let this cook for about another 2 mins before cautiously flipping the now sandwiched pancake."
- "Wait until the other side is cooked well. Carefully bring it out on a plate and enjoy !"

Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
