Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
