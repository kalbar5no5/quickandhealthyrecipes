For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.
