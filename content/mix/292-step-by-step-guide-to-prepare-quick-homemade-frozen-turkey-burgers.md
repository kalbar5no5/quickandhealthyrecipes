Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
