Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
