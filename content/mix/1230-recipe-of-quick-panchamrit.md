Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
