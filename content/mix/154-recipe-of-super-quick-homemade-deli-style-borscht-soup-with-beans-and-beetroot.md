Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
