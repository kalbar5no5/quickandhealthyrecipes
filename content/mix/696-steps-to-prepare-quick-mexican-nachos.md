Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
