Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
