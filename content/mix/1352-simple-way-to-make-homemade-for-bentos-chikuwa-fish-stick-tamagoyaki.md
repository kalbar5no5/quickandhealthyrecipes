Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
