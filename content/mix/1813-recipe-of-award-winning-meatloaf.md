Meatloaf has more flavour because whereas you wouldn&#39;t eat a hamburger without toppings, sauces, cheese and a bun, you can certainly eat Meatloaf plain because it&#39;s so juicy and tasty! The secret to making a meatloaf taste really good is to use fatty beef, plenty of flavourings and to grate your onion instead of dicing it. The best meat for meat loaf is any ground meat with a higher fat content. You can do a trio of beef, pork, and veal or stick with ground chuck. While you can substitute ground chicken or turkey for a healthy change, but just understand your meat loaf may not be as moist as the higher-fat varieties of meat. 

Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
