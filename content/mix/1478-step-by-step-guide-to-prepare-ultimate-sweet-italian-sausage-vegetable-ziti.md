Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
