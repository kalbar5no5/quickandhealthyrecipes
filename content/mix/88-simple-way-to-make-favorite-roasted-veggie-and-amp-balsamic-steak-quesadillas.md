Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
