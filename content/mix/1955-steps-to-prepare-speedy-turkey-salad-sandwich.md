I have told you many-a-times that I love Thanksgiving, but I appreciate this Holiday that much more because of the LEFTOVERS. I love fixing turkey for dinner. I always have leftover turkey and get to make turkey salad. This is my favorite sandwich--next is chicken salad. I use the same recipe to make chicken salad. 

Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
