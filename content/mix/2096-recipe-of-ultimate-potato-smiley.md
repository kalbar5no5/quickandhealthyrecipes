Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
