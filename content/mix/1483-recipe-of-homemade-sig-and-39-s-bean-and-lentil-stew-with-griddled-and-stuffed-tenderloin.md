Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
