Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
