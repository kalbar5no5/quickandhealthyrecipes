Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
