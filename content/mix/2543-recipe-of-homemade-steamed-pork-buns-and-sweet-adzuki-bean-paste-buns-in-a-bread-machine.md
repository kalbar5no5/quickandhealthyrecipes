How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
