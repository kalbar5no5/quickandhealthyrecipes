recipeingredient:
- "720 ml White rice"
- "1 sheet Kombu seaweed 2 x 3 cm square"
- "80 ml Sushi vinegar"
- "1 section large Lotus root"
- "50 ml Rice vinegar httpscookpadcomenrecipes188413mysushivinegarreciperefsearch"
- "2 Eggs"
- "2 tsp Sugar"
- "1 tsp or less Katakuriko slurry"
- "1 pinch Salt"
- "2 Aburaage"
- "4 small ones Dried shiitake mushrooms"
- "1 small one Carrot"
- "3 tbsp Sugar"
- "2 tbsp Soy sauce"
- "1 Sesame seeds to taste"
- "1 Green garnishes like mangetouts or mizuna leaves as needed"
recipeinstructions:
- "Rehydrate the shiitake mushrooms. Reserve the soaking water. Pour hot water over the aburaage to remove the excess oil."
- "Add the konbu seaweed and cook the rice with less water than usual."
- "Peel the lotus root and slice into thin quarters. Blanch in boiling water quickly and mix with rice vinegar while hot."
- "Julienne the carrot. Cut the aburaage in half and slice thinly. Thinly slice the rehydrated shiitake mushrooms. I used Kyoto carrots (they&#39;re deeper in colour than usual carrots, almost red). The rice will look better that way, so use them if you can find them where you are."
- "Heat vegetable oil in a pot and fry the carrot. After it wilts, add sugar. After the carrot is coated with sugar, add soy sauce, shiitake and aburaage and fry further. Add water you used to re-hydrate the shiitake and bring to a boil. Turn the heat off and leave to cool to allow the ingredients to absorb the flavour of the seasonings."
- "Add the ○ ingredients to the beaten eggs and mix well. Make thin omelettes. After it cools, slice thinly to make kinshi-tamago. If you add the katakuriko slurry to the egg mixture before cooking, the omelettes won&#39;t break apart easily."
- "After the rice is cooked, do not stir. Transfer to a moistened sushi wooden barrel straight away. Mix in the sushi vinegar quickly. It&#39;s important to cook the rice slightly harder than usual. Normally we use a fan to cool down the sushi rice quickly but it&#39;s a lot of work so instead I use the cold air setting of a hair dryer (laugh)."
- "Mix in the lotus root from Step 3 into the sushi rice and scatter sesame seeds. Place the cooled toppings from Step 5 and kinshi-tamago from Step 6. During Step 8, do not pour in any cooking liquid from Step 5. It will make the dish soggy. For 4 rice cooker cups of rice (720 ml)."
- "Place the green garnishes on top. I used baby chrysanthemum greens from my garden. Salad cress, quickly blanched mangetouts or mizuna leaves would be nice too."
- "Each person can portion out however much they want, so it&#39;s a great dish for parties and events."

Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
