Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
