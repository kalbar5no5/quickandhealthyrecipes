Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
