Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
