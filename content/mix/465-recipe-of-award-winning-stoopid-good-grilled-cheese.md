Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
