Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
