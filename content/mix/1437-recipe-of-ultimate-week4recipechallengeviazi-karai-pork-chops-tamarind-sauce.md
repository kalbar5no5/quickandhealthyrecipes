Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
