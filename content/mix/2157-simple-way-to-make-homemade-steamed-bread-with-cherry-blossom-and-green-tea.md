Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
