Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
