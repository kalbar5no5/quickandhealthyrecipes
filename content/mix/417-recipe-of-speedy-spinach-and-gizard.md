Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
