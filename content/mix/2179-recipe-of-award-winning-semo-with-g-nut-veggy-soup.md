I will make it again.&#34; - Misty Directions. In a stockpot, heat oil over medium-high heat; saute carrots, onions, celery and green pepper until crisp-tender. Slice off the tops of the onions, shave off the roots and peel the outer skins and place them into the pot whole. (Update: Fuhrman now recommends cutting the onions up so their enzymes can react while cooking as this increases their nutrition.) Soup is a comforting and warming mealâ€”and a great way to get your veggies in the winter when you don&#39;t feel like a cold salad. But sometimes, if it doesn&#39;t have enough protein, a vegetarian. Curry has a really distinctive ethnic flavor that works really well in some kinds of veggie soup. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
