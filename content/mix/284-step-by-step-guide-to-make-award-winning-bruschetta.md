Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!
