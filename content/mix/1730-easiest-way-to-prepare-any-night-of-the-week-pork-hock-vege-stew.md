Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
