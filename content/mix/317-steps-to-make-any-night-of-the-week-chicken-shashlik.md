Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
