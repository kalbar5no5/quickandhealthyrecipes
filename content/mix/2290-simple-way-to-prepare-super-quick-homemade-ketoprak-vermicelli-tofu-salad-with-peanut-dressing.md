Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
