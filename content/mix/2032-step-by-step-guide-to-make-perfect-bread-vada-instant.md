Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
