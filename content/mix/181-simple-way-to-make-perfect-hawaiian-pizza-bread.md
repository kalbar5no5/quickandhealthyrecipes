Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
