Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
