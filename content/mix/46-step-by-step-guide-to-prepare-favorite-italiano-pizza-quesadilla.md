Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.
