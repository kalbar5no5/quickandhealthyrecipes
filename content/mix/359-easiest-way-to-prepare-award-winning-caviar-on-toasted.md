How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
