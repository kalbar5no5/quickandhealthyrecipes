Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
