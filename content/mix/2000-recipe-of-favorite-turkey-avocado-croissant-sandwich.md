How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
