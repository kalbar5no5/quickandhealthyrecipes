Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
