How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
