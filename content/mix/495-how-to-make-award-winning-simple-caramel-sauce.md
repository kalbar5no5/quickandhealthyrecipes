Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
