Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
