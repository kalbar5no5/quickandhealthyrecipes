Bistek, or Filipino Beefsteak, is essentially steak and onions but with an Asian spin. Thinly-sliced beef is briefly marinated in calamansi (or lemon) and soy sauce, seared and simmered with the marinade and topped with onion slices. The smell of Filipino beef steak is enough to make one drool. &#34;Bistek,&#34; as it is otherwise called, looks simple but is a dish packed with complex flavors. A mild tang hits your tongue, followed by a burst of salty-savory flavor. The onion rounds it all out with its subtle sweetness. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
