Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
