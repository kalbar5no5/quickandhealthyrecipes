Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
