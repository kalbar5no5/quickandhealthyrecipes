Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
