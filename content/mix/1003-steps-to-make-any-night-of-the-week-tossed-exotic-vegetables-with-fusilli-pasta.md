Festive fusilli, tossed with roma (plum) tomatoes, garlic, chili peppers, olives and herbs, makes a dish just right for a casual get-together. A flavorful basil mint pesto is tossed with fusilli and vegetables like asparagus and spinach in this Italian-inspired vegetarian dish. I spotted a box of fusilli pasta in my pantry and immediately decided to make an Italian dish with green vegetables and a pesto! Fusilli is an ideal magnet for the sauce.

Meanwhile bring a large ot of salted water to a boil,ad the fusilli and cook as the label directs. Drain and trasfer to the skillet with the sauce. 

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
