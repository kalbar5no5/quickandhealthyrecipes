Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
