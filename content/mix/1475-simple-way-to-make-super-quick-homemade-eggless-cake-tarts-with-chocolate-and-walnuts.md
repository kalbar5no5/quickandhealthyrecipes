Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
