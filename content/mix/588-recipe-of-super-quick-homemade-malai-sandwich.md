Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
