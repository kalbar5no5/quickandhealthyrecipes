Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
