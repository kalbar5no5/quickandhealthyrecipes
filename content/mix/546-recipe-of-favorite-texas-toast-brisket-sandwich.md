Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
