Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
