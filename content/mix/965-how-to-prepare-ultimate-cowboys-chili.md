Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
