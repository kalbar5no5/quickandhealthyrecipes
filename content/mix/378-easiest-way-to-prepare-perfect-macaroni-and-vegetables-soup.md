Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
