Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
