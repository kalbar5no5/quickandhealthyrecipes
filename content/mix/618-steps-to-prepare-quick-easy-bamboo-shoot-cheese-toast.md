Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
