Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
