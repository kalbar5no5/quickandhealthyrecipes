Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
