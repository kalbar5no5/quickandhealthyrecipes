Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
