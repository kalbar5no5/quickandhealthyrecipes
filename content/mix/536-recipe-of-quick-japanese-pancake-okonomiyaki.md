Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
