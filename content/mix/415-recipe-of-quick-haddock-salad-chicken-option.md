Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!
