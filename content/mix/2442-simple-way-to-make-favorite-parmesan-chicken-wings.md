Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
