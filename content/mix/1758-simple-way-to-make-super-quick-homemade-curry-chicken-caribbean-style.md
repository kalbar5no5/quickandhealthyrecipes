Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
