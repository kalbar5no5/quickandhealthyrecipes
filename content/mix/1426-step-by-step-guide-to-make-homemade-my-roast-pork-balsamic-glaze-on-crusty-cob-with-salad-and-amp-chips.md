How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
