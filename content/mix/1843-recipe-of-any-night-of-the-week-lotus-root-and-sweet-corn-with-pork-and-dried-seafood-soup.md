How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
