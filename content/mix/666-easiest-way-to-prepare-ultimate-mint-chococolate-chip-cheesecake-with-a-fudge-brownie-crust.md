Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
