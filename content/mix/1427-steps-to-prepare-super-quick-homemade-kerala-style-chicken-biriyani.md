Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
