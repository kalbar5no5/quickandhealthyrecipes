Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!
