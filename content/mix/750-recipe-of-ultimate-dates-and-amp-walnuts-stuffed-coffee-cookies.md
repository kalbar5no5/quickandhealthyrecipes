Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
