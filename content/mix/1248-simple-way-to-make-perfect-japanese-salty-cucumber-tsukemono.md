Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
