Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body.
