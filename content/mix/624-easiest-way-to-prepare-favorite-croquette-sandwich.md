A croquette (croqueta) is a small finger length breadcrumb fried food roll that usually consists of minced ham, ground meat, or fish as its main ingredient. This delicious roux filling is either shaped into a cylinder or an oval shape. Then, it is rolled into seasoned breadcrumbs before being fried. Croquette Sandwich is one of my favorite sandwiches in Japanese bakeries.

Korokke is the Japanese form of the French word croquette, which describes a snack made from a filling such as meat or fish, bound together with a thickened sauce, formed into cylinders, breaded, and deep-fried. So &#34;Korokke Pan&#34; essentially means &#34;croquette bread,&#34; which may sound familiar to long-time readers of the site. Literally meaning &#34;mister crunch,&#34; the croque monsieur is a treasure trove of textures; pop a fried egg on top of your sandwich to transform it into a croque madame. The croque monsieur is a classic French sandwich made with ham and cheese.

Literally meaning &#34;mister crunch,&#34; the croque monsieur is a treasure trove of textures; pop a fried egg on top of your sandwich to transform it into a croque madame. The croque monsieur is a classic French sandwich made with ham and cheese. Transfer to a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining butter and sandwiches. Like a hot ham and cheese sandwich, but slathered with cream sauce and baked to bubbly perfection. (Yeah, it&#39;s as good as it sounds.) In France, the croque monsieur is traditionally served as a bar. Heat a skillet over medium heat. 

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
