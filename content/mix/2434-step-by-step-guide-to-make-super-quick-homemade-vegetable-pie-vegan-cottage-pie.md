Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
