Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
