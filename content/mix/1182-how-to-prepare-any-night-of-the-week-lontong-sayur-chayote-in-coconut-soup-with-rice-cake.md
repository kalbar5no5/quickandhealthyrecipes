Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
