DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest.
