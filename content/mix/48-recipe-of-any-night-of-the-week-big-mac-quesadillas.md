Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
