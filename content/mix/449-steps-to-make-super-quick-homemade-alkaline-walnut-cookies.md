How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
