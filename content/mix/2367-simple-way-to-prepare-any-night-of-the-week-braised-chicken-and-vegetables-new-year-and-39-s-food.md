Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
