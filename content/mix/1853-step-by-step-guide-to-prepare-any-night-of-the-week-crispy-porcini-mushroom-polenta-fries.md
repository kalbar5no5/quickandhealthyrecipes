Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
