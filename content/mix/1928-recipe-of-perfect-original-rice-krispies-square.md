Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
