The dish is named after the train in the Bicol region of the Philippines, known for its spicy food. Bicol Express is a popular Filipino dish in which the slices of pork meat is cooked with coconut milk, shrimp paste, and chili pepper. There&#39;s a belief that this dish was adapted from a Bicolano dish called &#34;Gulay na may Lada&#34;, meaning &#39;vegetable with chili&#39;. Pork Bicol Express has the entire characteristic that I enjoy in a pork dish. It is tender, creamy, and tasty. 

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
