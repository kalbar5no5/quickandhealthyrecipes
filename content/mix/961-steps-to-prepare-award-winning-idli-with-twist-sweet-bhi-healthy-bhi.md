Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
