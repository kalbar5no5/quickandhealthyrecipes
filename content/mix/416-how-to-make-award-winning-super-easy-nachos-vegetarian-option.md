Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
