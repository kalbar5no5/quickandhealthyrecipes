Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
