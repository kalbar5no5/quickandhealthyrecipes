Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
