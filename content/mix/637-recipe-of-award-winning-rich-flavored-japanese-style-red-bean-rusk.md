The adzuki bean is primarily grown in Japan and China, but can also be found in Korea, New Zealand, India, Taiwan, the Philippines and Thailand. Season with bay leaves, cayenne pepper, thyme, sage, parsley, and Cajun seasoning.

She didn&#39;t add all that stuff you buy today and the were delicious!&#34; Anpan (あんパン), or sweet red bean bun, is my favorite Japanese bread growing up. 

Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
