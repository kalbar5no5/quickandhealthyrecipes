Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
