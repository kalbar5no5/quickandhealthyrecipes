Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
