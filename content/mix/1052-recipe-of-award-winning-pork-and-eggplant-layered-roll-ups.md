Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
