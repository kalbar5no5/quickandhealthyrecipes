It has been a regular item in the menu of most restaurants because of its taste, ease in preparation and long shelf life. Leche Flan is the Filipino version of creme caramel. It is a sweet dish traditionally served as dessert at parties, fiestas, and other special occasions. It is also commonly used as topping for shaved ice such as halo-halo or in other treats such as floating island or graham de leche. Leche flan is traditionally steamed in the Philippines (where ovens were uncommon for many years), but baking it in a water bath is a great alternative if you don&#39;t have a steamer. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
