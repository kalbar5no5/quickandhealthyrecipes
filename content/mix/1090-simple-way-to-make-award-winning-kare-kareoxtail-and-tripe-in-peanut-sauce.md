Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
