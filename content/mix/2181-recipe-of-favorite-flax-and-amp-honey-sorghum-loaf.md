Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
