How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!
