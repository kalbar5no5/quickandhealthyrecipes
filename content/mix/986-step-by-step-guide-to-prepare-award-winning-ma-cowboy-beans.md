Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
