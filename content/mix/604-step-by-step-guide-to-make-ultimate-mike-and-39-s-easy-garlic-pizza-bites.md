Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
