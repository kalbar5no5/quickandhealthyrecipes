Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
