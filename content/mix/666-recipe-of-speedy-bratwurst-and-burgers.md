Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
