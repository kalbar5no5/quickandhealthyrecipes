Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
