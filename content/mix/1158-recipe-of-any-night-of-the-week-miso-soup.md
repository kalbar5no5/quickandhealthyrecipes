Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
