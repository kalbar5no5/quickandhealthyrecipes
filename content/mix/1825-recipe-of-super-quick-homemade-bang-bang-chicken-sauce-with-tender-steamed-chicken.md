- "If you kept the chicken in the pot, the gellified soup will turn liquid again when you heat it up a bit."
- "Attention: The chicken is cooked using the minimum heat needed to cook it through while still retaining its tenderness, so be sure not to overcook it in Steps 19 and 20."
- "Attention: When I specify &#34;medium heat&#34; in all the steps, I don&#39;t mean the middle setting of the hob; I mean &#34;medium heat&#34; in relation to the size of the pot you&#39;re using."
- "On my cooktop, using a 22 cm diameter Staub Cocotte Ronde, I set the heat on the hob to a bit to the right of center."

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
