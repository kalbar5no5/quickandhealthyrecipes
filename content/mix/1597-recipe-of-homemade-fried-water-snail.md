Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
