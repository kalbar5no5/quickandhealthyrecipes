How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
