Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
