How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
