Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
