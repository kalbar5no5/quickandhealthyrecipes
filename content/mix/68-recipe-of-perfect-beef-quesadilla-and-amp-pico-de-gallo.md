Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
