Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
