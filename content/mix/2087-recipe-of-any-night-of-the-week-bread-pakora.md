Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
