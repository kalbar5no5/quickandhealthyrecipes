Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
