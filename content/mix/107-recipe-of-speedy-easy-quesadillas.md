Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
