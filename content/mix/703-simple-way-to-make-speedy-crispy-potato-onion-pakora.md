Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
