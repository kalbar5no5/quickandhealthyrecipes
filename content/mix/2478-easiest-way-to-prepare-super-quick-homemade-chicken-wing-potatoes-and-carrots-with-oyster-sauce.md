Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
