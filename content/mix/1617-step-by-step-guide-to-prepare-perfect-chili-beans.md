Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
