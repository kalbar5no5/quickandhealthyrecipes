In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body.
