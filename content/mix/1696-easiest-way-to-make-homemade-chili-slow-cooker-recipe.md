Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
