Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
