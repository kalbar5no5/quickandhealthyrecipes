Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
