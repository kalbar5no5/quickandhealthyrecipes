Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
