Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
