Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
