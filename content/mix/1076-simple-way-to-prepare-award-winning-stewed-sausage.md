Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
