Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
