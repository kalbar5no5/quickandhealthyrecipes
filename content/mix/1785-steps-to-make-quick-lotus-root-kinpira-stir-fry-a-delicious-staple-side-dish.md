How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
