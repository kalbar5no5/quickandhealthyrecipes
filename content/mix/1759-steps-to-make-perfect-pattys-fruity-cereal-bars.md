How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
