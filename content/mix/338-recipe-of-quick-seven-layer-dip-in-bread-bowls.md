How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
