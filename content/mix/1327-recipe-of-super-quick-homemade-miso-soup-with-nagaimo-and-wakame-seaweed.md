Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
