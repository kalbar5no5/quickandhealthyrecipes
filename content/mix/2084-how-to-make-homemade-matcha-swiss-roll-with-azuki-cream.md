When I bake matcha sheet cake, I block the oven&#39;s bottom heat I like to fill my matcha roll with matcha whipped cream and red beans. 

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
