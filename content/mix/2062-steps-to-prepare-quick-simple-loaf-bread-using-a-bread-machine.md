Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
