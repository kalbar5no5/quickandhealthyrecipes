Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
