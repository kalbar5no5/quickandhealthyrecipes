Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
