Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
