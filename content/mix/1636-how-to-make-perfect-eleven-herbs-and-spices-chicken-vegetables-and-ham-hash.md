Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
