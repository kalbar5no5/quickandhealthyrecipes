A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine.
