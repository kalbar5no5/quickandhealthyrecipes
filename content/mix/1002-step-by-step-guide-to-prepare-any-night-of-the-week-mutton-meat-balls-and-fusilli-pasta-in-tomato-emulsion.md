Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
