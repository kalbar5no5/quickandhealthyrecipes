Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
