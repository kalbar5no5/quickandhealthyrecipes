Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
