Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
