Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
