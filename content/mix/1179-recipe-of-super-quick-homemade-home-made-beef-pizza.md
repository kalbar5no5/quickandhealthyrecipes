Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body.
