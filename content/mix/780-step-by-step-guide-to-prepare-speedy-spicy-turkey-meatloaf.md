Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
