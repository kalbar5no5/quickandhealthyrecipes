Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
