Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at battling depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
