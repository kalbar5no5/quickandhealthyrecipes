Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
