How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
