How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
