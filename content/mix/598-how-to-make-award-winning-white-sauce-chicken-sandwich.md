Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
