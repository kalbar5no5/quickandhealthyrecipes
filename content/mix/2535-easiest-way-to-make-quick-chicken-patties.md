Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
