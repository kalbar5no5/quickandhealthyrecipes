One of my favorites is pineapple, everything from chili on top to Pina Coladas! The cashews were super crunchy and I didn&#39;t like that when I first ate it. I had enough for leftovers, and when I ate it that night the cashews had softened up. Fluffy rice studded with juicy chunks of pineapple and shrimp comes together with the signature flavors of South East Asia, including ground ginger, cilantro and red pepper. Remove shrimp to a plate with a slotted spoon. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
