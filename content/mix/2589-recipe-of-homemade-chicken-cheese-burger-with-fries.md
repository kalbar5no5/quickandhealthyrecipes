Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
