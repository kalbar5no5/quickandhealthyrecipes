How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
