Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
