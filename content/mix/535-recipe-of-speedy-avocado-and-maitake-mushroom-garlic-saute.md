Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
