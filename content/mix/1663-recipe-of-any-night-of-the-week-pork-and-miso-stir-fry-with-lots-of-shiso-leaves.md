Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
