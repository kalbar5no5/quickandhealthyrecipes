Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
