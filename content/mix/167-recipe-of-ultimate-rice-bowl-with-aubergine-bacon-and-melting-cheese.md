How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
