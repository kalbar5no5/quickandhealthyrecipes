Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
