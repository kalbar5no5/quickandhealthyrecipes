recipeingredient:
- "125 grams Bread strong flour"
- "125 grams Cake flour"
- "4 grams Instant dry yeast"
- "4 grams Salt"
- "6 grams Sugar"
- "1 tbsp Olive oil"
- "160 grams Lukewarm water"
recipeinstructions:
- "These are the ingredients."
- "Combine the bread and cake flours, yeast, salt and sugar in a bowl. Add lukewarm water. Start by mixing it in with cooking chopsticks or something, then switch to folding the dough with your hands."
- "When the dough is more or less mixed, add the olive oil. Knead to incorporate the flour in the bowl."
- "Take the dough out onto a work surface and knead and stretch for about 10 minutes."
- "Ideally you want the dough to form a thin, translucent film when stretched (as they say often in cookbooks), but you don&#39;t have to knead it that long really."
- "Round the dough off into a ball with a smooth, taut surface."
- "This is how the dough looks before the 1st rising. (Put the dough on the lid of a large storage container, and invert the container over the dough. Leave it to rise.)"
- "After about an hour. (The measuring cup full of hot water is there to maintain the temperature.)"
- "Today I just divided the dough into 4 pieces. Usually I divide it into 5 to 6 pieces, which may be easier to bake."
- "Round off each piece of dough into a ball with a smooth surface."
- "This dough doesn&#39;t need to be rested much. Once each piece is formed into a smooth ball, go to the next step."
- "Flour your hands before pressing each dough ball flat. Use the weight of the dough itself to help stretch it out. Make the edges a bit thicker than the middle. This is a better way to stretch the dough than rolling it out with a rolling pin--the dough is puffier this way."
- "Line a baking tray with parchment paper and put the dough on top. Go on to the 2nd rising. Put the whole baking tray in a plastic bag or something to proof. In the meantime, preheat the oven to 230째C. If you have an electric oven, set it to the highest setting."
- "The dough will become puffy in about 30 minutes. Top with olive oil and coarse rock salt and so on. Add rosemary or other herbs to taste."
- "It depends on your oven, but basically just bake at 230째C for 3 to 5 minutes until lightly browned, and it&#39;s done."
- "The surface is soft too, not hard. For a cinnamon flavored version, top with butter before baking, and sprinkle with granulated sugar and cinnamon powder."
- "Spread on pizza sauce, top with cheese, and you have a simple pizza."
- "Here are some plain round buns made with the same dough."
- "Variation: Salad pizza! I put an arugula and cured ham salad on top of a baked focaccia, with mayonnaise diluted with yogurt."
- "Variation: Light pizza! No tomato sauce, topped with bacon and sliced bell peppers, mozzarella cheese and olive oil."
- "Variation: Dessert pizza! Sprinkle cinnamon powder on sliced banana and bake. Add lots of chocolate sauce to finish."
- "Once the foccacia have cooled, wrap up any that you won&#39;t eat right away and store in the refrigerator or freezer. Mist with water and warm in a toaster oven before eating."

Focaccia is our favorite yeast-bread to make at home. It has a crisp outside and soft inside, and is perfect to serve with dinner, soups, stews, or even sliced in half and used for sandwiches. Thanks to the ingredients, it&#39;s also naturally vegan. More from Inspired Taste Perfect for feeding a crowd, focaccia is a flavorful and easy-to-make Italian flat bread baked in a sheet pan. It&#39;s made with a yeast dough that rises twice: once before it is shaped and then again after it is shaped (so be sure to allow plenty of time). 

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
