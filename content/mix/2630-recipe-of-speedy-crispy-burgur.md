Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
