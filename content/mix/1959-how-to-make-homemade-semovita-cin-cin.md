Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
