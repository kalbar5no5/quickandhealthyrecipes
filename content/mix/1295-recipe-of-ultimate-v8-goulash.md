This American Goulash is pure comfort food made all in one pot. Made with simple ingredients: ground beef, canned tomatoes and macaroni. When you take it out, be sure to thaw it overnight in the refrigerator. To prepare, reheat in the microwave or a large saucepan over medium heat. Keep in mind though that when you freeze goulash, the pasta continues to absorb the liquid - becoming softer. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
