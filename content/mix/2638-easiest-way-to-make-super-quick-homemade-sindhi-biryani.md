Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
