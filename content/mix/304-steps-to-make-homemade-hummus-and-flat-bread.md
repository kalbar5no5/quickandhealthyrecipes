Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
