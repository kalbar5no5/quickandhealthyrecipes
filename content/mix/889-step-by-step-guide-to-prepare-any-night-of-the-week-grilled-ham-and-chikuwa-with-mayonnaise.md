How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
