Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
