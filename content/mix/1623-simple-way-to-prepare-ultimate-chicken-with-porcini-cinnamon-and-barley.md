Bring to a boil, lower heat and cook for 25 minutes. remove from the heat, cover and set aside while you make the chicken.

Sprinkle over the remaining thyme and sage. Cook for an additional couple of minutes to brown the other side of the chicken as well."
- "While the chicken is browning, remove the cinnamom stick and the mushrooms from the mushroom soaking water. Discard the cinnamon stick. Remove any tough or hard pieces from the mushrooms and discard. Chop the remainder. Strain the mushroom stock through a coffee filter and reserve."

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
