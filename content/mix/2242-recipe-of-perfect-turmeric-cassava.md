Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
