Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
