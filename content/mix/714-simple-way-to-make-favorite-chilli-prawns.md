Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
