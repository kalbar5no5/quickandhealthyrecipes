Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
