How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
