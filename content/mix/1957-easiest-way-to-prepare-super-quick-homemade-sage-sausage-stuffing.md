Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
