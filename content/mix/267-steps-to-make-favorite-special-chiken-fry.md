Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
