Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
