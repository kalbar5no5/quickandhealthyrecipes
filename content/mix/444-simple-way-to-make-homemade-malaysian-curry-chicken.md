How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
