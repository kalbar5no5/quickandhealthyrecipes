Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
