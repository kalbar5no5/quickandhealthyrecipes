Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
