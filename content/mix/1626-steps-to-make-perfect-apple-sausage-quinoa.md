Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
