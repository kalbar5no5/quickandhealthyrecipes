Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
