Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
