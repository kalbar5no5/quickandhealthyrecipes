Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
