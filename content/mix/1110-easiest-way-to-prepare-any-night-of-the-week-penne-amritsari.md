Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at combating depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
