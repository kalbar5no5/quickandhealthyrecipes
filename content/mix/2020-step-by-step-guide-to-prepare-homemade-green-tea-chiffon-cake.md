Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
