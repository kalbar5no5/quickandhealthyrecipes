Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
