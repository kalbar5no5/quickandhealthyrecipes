Twisted doughnuts are known as kkwabaegi (꽈배기) in Korean. In geometry, a torus (plural tori) is a surface of revolution generated by revolving a circle in three-dimensional space about an axis that is coplanar with the circle. Our doughnut recipe uses a secret ingredient - you&#39;ll have to try it to believe it - that makes sugared ring doughnuts, and yum yums, which are great when glazed. Doughnuts are usually deep fried from a flour dough, and typically either ring-shaped or without a hole, and often filled. These cinnamon sugar twist doughnuts are a cross between crunchy churros and soft, fluffy The original dough recipe yields a dozen doughnut rings and a dozen or so doughnut holes. 

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
