Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
