Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
