Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
