Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
