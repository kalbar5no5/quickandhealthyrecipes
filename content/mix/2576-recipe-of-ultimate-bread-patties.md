Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
