Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
