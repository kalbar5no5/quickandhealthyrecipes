Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
