Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
