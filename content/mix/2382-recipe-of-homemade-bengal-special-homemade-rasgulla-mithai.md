Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
