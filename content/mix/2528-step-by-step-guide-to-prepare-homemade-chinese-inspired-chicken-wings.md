Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
