Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
