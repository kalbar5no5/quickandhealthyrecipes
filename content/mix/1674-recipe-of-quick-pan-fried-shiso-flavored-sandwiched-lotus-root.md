Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
