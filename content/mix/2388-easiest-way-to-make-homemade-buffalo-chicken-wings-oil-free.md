Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
