Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
