Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
