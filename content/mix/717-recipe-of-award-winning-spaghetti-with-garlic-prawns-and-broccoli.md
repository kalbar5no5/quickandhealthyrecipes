How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
