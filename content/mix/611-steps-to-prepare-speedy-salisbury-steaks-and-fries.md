Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
