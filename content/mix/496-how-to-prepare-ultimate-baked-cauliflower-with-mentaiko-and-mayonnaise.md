Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
