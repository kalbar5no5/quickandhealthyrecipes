Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
