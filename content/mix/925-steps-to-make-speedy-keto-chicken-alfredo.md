Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
