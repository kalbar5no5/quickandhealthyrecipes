Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
