Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
