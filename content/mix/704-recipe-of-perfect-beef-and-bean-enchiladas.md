Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
