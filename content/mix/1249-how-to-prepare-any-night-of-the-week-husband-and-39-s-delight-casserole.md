Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
