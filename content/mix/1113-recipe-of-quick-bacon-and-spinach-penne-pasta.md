How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!
