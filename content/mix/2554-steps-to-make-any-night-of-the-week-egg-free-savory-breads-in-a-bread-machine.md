recipeinstructions:
- "Put the dough ingredients in a bread machine and start. Once the dough has come together in a cohesive ball, add the butter (or other fat). If this is a bother, just put all the ingredients in at once."
- "Drain the tuna and corn well. Cut the ham slices in half."
- "When the dough is done, divide into 2 portions. Form into smooth balls with the seam sides down. Cover with a moist but tightly wrung out kitchen towel. Leave to rest for 15 minutes."
- "Roll out each piece of dough using a rolling pin, rolling up and down and left to right, until each piece is about 20 x 15 cm in size. Make the (A) filling roll: Spread on the mustard to start."
- "Leave a 1-2 cm gap on the long (20 cm) side for both A and B versions. This makes the dough easier to seal up after it&#39;s rolled."
- "Add the mayonnaise, corn and sliced cheese to the mustard-spread portion. Don&#39;t add too much mayonnaise or you won&#39;t be able to seal the dough together as easily."
- "For the (B) version, roll the dough out in the same way and spread with mayonnaise. Add pepper, ham slices cut in half, and tuna."
- "Roll up the dough from the side nearest you. Pinch the seam closed with your fingers."
- "Roll lightly with both hands to form a cylinder."
- "Cut into 5 pieces with a knife, put into aluminium cups and leave to rise (2nd rising), at 35 to 40°C until doubled in volume."
- "Preheat the oven to 200°C. When the bread has finished rising, top with some onion and melting cheese."
- "Once the oven has heated up, lower the temperature to 180°C, add the formed bread from Step 11 and bake. It&#39;s done in about 15 minutes. Optionally sprinkle with parsley."
- "If you don&#39;t have skim milk powder, use 100 g of water (instead of 200 g) and add 100 g of milk, for a total of 200 g of liquid. You could also use 200 g of milk."
- "If you don&#39;t have unsalted butter, use salted butter or margarine. Note that I have used a minimal amount of fat. Add 10 g more butter for a richer dough."
- "The usual fillings for this type of bread are ham + cheese, corn, tuna etc. but use whatever you like."

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
