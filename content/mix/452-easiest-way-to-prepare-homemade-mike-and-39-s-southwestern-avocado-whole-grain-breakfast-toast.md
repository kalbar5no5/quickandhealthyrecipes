Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
