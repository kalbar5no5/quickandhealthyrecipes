How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
