Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
