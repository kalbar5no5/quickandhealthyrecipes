Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
