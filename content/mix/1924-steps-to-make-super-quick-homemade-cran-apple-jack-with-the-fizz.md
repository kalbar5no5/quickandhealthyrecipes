Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
