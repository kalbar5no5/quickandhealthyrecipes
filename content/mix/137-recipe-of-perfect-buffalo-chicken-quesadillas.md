Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
