Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
