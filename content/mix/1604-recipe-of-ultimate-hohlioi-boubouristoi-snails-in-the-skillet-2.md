Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
