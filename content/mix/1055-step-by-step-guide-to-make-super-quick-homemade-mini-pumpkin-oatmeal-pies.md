Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
