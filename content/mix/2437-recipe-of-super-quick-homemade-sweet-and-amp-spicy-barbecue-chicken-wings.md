Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
