Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
