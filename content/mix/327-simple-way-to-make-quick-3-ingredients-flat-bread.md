Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
