Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
