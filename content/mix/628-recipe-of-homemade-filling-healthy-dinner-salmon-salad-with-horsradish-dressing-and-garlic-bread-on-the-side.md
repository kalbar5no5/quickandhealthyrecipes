Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
