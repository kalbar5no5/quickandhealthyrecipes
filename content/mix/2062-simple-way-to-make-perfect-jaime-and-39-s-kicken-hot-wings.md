Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
