Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
