Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
