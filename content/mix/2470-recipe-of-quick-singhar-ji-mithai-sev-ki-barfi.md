Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
