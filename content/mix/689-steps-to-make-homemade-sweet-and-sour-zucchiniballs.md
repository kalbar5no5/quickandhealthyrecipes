Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at battling depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
