How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
