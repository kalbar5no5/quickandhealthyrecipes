Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
