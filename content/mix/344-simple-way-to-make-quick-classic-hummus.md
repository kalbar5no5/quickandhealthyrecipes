Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
