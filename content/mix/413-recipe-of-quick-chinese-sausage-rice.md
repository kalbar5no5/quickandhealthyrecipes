How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
