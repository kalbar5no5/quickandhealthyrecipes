Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
