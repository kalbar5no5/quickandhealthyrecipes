Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
