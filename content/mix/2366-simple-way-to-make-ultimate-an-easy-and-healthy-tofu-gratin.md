Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body.
