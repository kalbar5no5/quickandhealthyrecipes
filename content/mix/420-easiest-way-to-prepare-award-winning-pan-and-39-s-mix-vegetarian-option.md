Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
