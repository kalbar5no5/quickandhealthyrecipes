Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
