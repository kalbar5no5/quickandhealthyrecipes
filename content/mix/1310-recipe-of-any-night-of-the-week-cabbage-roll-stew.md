Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
