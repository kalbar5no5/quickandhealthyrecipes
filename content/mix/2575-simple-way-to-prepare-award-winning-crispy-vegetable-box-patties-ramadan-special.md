Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!
