Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
