Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
