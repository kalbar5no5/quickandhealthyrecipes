Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
