Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
