How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
