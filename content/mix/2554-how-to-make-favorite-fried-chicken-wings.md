Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body.
