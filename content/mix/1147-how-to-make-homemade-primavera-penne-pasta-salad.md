Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
