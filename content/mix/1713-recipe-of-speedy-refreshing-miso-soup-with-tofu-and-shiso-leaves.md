Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
