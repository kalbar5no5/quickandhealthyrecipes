Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
