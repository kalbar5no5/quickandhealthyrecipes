Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
