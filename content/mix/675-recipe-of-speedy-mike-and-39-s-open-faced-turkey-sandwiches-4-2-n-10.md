Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
