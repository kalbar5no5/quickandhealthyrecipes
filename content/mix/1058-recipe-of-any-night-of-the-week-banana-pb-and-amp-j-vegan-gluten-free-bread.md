Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
