Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
