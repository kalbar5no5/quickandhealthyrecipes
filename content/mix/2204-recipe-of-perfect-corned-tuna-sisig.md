Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
