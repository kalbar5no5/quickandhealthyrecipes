Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
