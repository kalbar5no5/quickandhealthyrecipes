How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
