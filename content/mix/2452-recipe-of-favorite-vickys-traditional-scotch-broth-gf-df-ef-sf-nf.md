Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
