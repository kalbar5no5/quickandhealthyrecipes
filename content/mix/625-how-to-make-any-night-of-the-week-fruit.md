Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
