Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
