Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
