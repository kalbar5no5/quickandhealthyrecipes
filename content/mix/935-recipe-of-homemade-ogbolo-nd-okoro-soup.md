Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
