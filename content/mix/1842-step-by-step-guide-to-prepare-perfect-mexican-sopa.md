Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
