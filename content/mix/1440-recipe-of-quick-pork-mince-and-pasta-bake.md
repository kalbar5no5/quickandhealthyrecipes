Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
