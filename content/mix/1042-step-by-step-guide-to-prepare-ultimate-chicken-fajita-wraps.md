Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
