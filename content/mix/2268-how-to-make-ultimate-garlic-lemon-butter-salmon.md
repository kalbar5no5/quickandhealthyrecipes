Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
