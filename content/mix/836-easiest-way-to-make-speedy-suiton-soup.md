Suiton &amp; River Crab Soup is a unique dish that pairs simple dumplings with a thick, rich soup. The base of the soup is made by finely and painstakingly grinding down whole crabs to make an intensely flavorful stock. S uiton, or hittsumi in the local dialect, are simple hand-pulled dumplings made with wheat grown right in the Nanbu area. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
