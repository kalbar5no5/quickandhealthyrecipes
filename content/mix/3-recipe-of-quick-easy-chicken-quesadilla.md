The key to this super easy recipe is the chicken. These quesadillas are loaded with shredded chicken. Even better, I use a Rotisserie chicken from the deli department at my local grocery store to save on cooking time. It cuts way down on prep time and, since the Rotisserie has all those wonderful flavors already, it saves time on extra.

It cuts way down on prep time and, since the Rotisserie has all those wonderful flavors already, it saves time on extra. Roast up your own chicken breast or make it even easier on yourself by using a prepared rotisserie chicken. Game plan: These quesadillas can also be made on an outdoor grill. Then build the quesadillas by laying grated cheese on the bottom. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
