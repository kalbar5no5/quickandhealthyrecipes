How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
