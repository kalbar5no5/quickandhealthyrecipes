Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
