How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
