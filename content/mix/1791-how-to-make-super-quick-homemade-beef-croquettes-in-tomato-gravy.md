Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
