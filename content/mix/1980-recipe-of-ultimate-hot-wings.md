Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
