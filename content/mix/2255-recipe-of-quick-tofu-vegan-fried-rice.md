Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
