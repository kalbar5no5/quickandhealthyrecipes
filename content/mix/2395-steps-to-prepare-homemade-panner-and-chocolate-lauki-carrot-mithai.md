Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
