Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
