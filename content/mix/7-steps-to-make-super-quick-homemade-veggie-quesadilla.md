Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
