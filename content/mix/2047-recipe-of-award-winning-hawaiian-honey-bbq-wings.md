Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
