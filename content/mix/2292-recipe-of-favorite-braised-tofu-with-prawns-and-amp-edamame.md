Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
