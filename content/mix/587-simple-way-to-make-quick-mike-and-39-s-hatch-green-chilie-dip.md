Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
