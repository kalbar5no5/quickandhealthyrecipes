Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
