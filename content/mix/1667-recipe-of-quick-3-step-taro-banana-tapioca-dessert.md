Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
