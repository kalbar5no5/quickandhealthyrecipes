Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
