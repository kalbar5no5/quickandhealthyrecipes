Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
