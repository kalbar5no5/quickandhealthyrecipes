Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
