The high gluten content means the flour is especially well suited for making pasta, but this flour is also a common ingredient in bread and baked goods as well as couscous. Semolina is available throughout the world but is most popular in Italy. Cake doughnuts (my personal favorite) are made with a sweet dough leavened by baking powder.
