Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
