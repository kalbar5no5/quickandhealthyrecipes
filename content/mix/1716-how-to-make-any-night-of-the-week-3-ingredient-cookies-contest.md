They are light, fluffy and thick, rich cookie that has the perfect peanut butter balance. Once they are cooked golden brown in oven enjoy warm with a cold glass of milk. Made with peanut butter and oatmeal, it can be made with or without the banana and is the perfect quick and easy breakfast! I REALLY love using a European style butter in this recipe, as the fat content is slightly higher, meaning it will be that much more rich and flavorful. These unbelievably easy -- and gluten-free -- cookies have only three ingredients and are a great way to use up those extra mixed nuts hanging out in. 

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
