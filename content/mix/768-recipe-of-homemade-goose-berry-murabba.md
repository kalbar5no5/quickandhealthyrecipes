Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
