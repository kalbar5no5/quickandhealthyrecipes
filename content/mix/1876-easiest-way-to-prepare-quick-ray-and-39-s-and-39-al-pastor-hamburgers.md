Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
