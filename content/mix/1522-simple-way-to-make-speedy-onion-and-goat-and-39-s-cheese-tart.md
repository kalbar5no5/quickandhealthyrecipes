Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
