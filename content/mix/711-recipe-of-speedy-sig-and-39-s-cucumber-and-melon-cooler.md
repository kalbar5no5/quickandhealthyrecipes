Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
