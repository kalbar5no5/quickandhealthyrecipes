Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
