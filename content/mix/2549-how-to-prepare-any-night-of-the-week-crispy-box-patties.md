Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
