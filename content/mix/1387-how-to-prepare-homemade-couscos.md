Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
