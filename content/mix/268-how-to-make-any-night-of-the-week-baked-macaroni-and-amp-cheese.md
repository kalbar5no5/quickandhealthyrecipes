Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
