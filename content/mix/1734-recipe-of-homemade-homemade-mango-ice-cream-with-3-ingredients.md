Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
