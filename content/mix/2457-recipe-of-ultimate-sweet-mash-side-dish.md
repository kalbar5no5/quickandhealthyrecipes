Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
