Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
