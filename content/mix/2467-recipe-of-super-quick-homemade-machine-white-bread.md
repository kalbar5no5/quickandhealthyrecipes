Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body.
