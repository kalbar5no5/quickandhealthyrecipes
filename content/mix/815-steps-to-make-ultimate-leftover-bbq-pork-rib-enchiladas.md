Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
