Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
