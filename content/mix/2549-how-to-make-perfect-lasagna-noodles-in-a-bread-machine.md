Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
