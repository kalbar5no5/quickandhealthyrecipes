Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
