Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
