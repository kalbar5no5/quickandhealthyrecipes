How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
