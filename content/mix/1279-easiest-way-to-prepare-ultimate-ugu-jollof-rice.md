Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
