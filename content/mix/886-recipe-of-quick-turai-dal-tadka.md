Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
