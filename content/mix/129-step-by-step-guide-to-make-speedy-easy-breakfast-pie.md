How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
