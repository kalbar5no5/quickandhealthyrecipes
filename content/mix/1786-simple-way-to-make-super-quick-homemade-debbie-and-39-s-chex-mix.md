Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
