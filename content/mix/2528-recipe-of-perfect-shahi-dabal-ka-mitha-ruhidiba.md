Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
