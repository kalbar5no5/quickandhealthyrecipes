Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
