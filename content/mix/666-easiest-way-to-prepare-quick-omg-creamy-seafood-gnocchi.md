Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
