Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
