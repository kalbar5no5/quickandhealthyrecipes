Then, most meals must be dehydrated in the dehydrator to soften or remove moisture from nuts, seeds and crackers. A strict nut-free diet means avoiding all tree nuts and seeds including almonds, brazil nuts, cashews, chestnuts, ginkgo nuts, hazelnuts, hickory nuts, lichee nuts, macadamia nuts, pecans, pine. These simple, sweet raw vegan recipes are nut-free. (Some recipes may include seeds, like sunflower or sesame seeds.) These recipes are perfect if you have an allergy, food sensitivity or are looking to keep your nut consumption down. Raw Nuts Might Contain Harmful Bacteria and Fungi Potentially harmful bacteria, such as Salmonella and E. coli, might be present in raw nuts. That&#39;s because nuts are sometimes thrown on or fall to. 

Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
