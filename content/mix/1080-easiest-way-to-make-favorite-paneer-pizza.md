Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
