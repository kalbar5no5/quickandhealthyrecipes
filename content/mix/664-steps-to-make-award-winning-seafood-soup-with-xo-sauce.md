Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
