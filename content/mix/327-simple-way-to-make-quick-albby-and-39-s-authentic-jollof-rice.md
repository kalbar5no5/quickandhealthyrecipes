Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
