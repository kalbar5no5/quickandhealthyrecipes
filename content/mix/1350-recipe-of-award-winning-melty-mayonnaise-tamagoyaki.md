Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
