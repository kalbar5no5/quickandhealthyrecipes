Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
