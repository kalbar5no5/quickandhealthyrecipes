Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
