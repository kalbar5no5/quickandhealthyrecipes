Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body.
