Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
