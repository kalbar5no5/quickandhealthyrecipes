Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
