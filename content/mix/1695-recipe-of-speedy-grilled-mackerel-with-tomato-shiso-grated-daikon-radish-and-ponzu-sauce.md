Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
