Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
