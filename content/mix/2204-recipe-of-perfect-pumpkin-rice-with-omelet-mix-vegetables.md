Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
