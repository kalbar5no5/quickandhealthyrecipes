Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
