recipeinstructions:
- "To prepare the pork, lay chunks of shoulder meat in a crock pot. Preferably deboned. After 1 layer sprinkle seasonings over meat. Don&#39;t skimp. Layer more meat in and repeat. Drizzle vinegar over and close. Cook on low 8 hrs, then switch to warm."
- "For the sauce, destem and seed chiles. Place in a LG sauce pot. Just cover chiles with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes."
- "Spoon out a cup of the cooking liquid, place in a bowl with the dried shrimp. Let sit 15 minutes. Add spices and bouillon to chiles. Simmer another 10 minutes."
- "When chiles and shrimp are done, combine and let mixture cool. When able to handle, liquefy all ingredients in a blender. In batches, including all of the liquid. Let sit in the fridge overnight."
- "The next day, shred pork with a fork. Add a little bit more of the pork seasoning and 2 to 3 cups of the sauce. Fry in a large pan long enough for the pork to soak up the sauce. You don&#39;t want a lot of liquid in it though. This is the filling."
- "Next make the dough. Mix all dry ingredients. Cut in lard. Then mix the hot water in a bit at a time. Meanwhile, soak the corn husks in warm water 15 minutes or so."
- "When husks are pliable, find a small husk. Rip it into strips. This is what you will tie with."
- "Spread a thin layer of dough in the husk. About 3 x 5 inches."
- "Add 1 to 1/2 tbs filling on top of dough. Roll corn husk up like a burrito. Tie in the center with a double knot. Repeat many more times."
- "I used an auto steamer. You can use a LG pot if you have a rack to keep the tamales out of the water while steaming. Either way, layer tamales in your preferred cooking method. Steam for 45-55 minutes. This batch made about 4 dozen. I place in freezer bags and freeze. Good quick snack."
- "Meanwhile heat butter in a frying pan. Add flour and mix well. Don&#39;t cook until browned. Just before it turns. Slowly add the rest of the Chile puree. Cook until sauce thickens. Adjust seasoning to taste."
- "When tamales are done, remove husk and plate. Serve with sauce over the top and shredded cheddar cheese. Serve immediately. Enjoy."

Here I have for you my version of how I make pork Tamales. I go step by step with you to try and give you an easy understanding of the process, from starting. Red chile pork tamales that are authentic Mexican through and throughâ€”sweet corn masa dough enveloping a richly spiced, knee-wobblingly tender pork filling. One of the most popular kinds of Mexican tamales are red chile pork (or &#39;tamales rojos&#39;) made from tender pork shoulder that&#39;s been simmered in a rich red chile sauce. The filling is enveloped in a light and addicting masa dough and then steamed in corn husks on the stovetop for a few hours. 

How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
