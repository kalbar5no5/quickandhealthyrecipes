How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
