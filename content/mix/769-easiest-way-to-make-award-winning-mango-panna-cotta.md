Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
