Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
