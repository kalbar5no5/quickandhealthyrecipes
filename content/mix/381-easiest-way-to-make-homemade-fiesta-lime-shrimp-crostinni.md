Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
