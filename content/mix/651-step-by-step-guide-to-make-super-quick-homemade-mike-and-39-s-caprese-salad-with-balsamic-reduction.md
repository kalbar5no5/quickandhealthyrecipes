- " Caprese Salad With Vinegar Reduction"
- "1 (16 oz) Quality Mozterella Cheese"
- "1 Quality Bottle Balsamic Vinegar"
- "1 package Fresh Basil Leaves or 12 cup from your garden"
- "2 LG Extra Firm Beefeater Tomatoes"
- "1 tsp Sea Salt divided"
recipeinstructions:
- "Slice tomatoes and Mozterella. Gather your fresh Basil leaves."
- "Construct your salads."
- "Lightly drizzle your olive oil and Balsamic Vinegar on top your salad. Sprinkle salad with sea salt."
- "Serve chilled as an antipasto. [a starter or appetizer]"
- "REDUCTION INSTRUCTIONS  In a small, nonreactive pan, add your balsamic vinegar and any other herbs you prefer.  Turn your kitchen fan on and open a window as the vinegar fumes will waft throughout your home.   Bring vinegar to a simmer over medium-high heat, then turn down heat to keep it at a low simmer. This process will take about 10 - 15 minutes to thicken up and reduce. Watch very closely at the end as you don&#39;t want to burn your reduction. When it coats a spoon, you&#39;ll know it&#39;s completed.   Your sauce will thicken up considerably once it has cooled. You can make it less thick or, make it as thick as molasses. Anything more will result in burning. To thin once cooled, gently reheat and add a little water as needed."

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
