Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
