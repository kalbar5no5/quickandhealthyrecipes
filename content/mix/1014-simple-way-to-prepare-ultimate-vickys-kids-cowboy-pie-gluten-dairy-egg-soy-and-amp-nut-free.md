##### Steps to make Vickys Kids Cowboy Pie, Gluten, Dairy, Egg, Soy &amp; Nut-Free:

1. Boil the peeled and quartered potatos until soft, meanwhile bake the sausages in the oven at gas mark 5 / 190C / 375F, turning after 12 minutes.
1. The potatos should be done after 20 mins. Drain and add enough butter and milk to make a creamy mash. Season gently
1. Check the sausages after 25 mins total, they should be done.
1. Heat the beans in a pan, then layer in the bottom of a casserole dish. Cut the sausages into chunks and layer over the beans then spread the mash on top. Older kids may prefer the sausages poked upright through the top of the mash rather than cut up.
1. If you wish you can put it under the grill to crisp the potato, or sprinkle cheese on top. My kids like theirs in individual dishes so they have their own &#39;pies&#39;


Use the pie crust of your choice. I don&#39;t f*** with pie crust, so in the pictured pie I used a store bought gluten-free crust made by Wholly Wholesome (it was okay). To make the pie completely gluten-free, just use oat flour, gluten-free AP flour, or some other mild wheat-less flour in the filling. But whatever you do, don&#39;t use chickpea flour. Food allergies or sensitivities to gluten, soy, dairy and egg are relatively common and can make meal planning a complicated endeavor. 

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
