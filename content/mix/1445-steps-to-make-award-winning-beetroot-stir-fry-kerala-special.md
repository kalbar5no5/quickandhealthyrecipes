Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
