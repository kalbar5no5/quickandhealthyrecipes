Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
