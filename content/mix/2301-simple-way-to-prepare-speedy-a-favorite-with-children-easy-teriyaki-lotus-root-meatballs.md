Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
