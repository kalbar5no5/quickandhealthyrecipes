Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
