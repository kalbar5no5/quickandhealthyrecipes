recipeingredient:
- "1 lb ground beef"
- "1 packet onion soup mix"
- "1/4 teaspoon pepper"
- "1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt"
- "1/4 teaspoon oregano"
- "1/4 teaspoon basil"
- "1 onion finely chopped"
- "1 cup celery chopped"
- "1 cup carrots chopped"
- "8 oz can tomato sauce"
- "1 tablespoon soy sauce"
- " Beef broth or water and beef bullion"
- "1 cup macaroni noodles or whatever pasta you prefer no one is here to judge"
- " Parmesan cheese"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put meat in slow cooker. I like to brown the meat first so it is already separated and the grease content is low."
- "Add onion soup mix, pepper, seasoned salt, oregano, basil, onion, celery, carrots, tomato sauce, and soy sauce to the slow cooker."
- "Add as much beef broth as you like. Or, if you are like me and prefer to add water and bullion cubes make sure you add one cube per 1 - 1 1/2 cups of water. The amount of broth depends on what you like. Because the pasta (see below step) absorbs so much, I would say to put at least 5 or 6 cups of broth in. If you dont like a lot of broth, put in less. There is no legal statute dictating how much to put in. Gotta love America."
- "Cook for no less than 4 hours to get the flavors to swirl around. Plus, don&#39;t you love the intoxicating aroma of soup filling the halls of your house? Any longer than 8 hours, even on low setting, can dry the meat out, especially if you substitute with ground turkey."
- "15 to 20 minutes prior to serving, add the macaroni. I like the whole wheat kind. It gives me the illusion that I am somehow being healthier. If you like science, watch the broth levels lower while the mass of the noodles increase."
- "Serve with parmesan cheese on top. It gives the soup that extra something special."
- "Photos are forthcoming once I make this again. DISCLAIMER: if you like soup that sucks, this one is not for you. If you like soup that doesn&#39;t suck, then you my friend are in for a treat!"

When my Grandma always made her hamburger soup, she never added noodles.

When it comes to easy dinner recipes, I rely a lot on ground beef. 

Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
