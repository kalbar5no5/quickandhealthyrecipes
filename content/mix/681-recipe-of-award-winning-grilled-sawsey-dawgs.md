Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
