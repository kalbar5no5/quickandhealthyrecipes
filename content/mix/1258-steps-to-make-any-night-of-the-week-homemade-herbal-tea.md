Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
