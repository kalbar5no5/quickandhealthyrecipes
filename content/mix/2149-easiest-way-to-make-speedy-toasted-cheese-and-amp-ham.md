Blue cheeses also work well but do make sure it is mature and semi-hard. Butter a slice of white bread on both sides. Try sourdough for a tangy flavor, or an airy bread like ciabatta if you like the cheese oozing through the holes and burning on the pan. Buttering both sides will create a golden crust and a moist interior.

Try sourdough for a tangy flavor, or an airy bread like ciabatta if you like the cheese oozing through the holes and burning on the pan. Buttering both sides will create a golden crust and a moist interior. If you use unsalted butter, add a pinch of salt to the pan to add more flavor. Generously butter one side of a slice of bread. Sprinkle a little finely grated Parmesan cheese on top of the butter. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
