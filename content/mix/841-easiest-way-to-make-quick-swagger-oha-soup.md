Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
