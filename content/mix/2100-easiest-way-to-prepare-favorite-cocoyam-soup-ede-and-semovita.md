How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
