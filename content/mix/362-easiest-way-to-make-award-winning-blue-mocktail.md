Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
