Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
