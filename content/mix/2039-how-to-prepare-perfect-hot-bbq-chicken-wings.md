Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
