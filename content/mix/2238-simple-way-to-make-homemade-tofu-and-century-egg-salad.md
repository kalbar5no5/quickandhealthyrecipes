Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
