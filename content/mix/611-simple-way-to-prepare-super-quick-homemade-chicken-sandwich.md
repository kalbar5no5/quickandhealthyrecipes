Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
