Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
