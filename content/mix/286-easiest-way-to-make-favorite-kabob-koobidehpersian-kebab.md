Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
