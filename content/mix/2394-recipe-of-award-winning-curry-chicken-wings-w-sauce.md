Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
