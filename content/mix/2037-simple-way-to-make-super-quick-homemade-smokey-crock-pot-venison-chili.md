This Slow Cooker Venison Chili is my favorite way to use up venison! I use three different types of peppers; jalapeño, Anaheim, and yellow bell pepper. It is just the right amount of heat! I top the chili with cheddar cheese, green onions, and serve cornbread on the side. Place the venison and sausage in a large skillet and cook, breaking up with a wooden spoon as necessary, over medium heat until no longer pink and evenly browned. 

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
