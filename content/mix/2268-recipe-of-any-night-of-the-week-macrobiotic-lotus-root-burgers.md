Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
