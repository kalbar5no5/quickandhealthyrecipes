Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
