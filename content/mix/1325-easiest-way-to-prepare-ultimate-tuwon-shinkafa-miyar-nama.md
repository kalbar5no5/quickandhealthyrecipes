Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
