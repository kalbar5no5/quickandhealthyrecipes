Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
