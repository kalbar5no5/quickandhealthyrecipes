Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!
