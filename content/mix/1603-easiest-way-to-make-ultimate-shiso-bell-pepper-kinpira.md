Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
