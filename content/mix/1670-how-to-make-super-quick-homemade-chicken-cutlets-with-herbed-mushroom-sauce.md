Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
