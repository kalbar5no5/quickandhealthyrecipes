Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
