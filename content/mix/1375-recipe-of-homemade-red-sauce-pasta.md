Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
