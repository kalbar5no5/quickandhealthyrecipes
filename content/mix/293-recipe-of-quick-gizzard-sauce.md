Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
