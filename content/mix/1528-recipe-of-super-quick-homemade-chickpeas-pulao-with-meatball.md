Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
