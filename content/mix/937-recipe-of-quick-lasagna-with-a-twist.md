Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
