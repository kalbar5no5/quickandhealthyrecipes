Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
