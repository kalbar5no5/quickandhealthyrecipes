Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
