Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
