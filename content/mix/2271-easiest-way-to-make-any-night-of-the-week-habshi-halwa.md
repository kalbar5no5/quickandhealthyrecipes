How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
