How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
