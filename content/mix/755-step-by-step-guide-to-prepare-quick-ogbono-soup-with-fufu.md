Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
