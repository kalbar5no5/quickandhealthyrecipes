Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
