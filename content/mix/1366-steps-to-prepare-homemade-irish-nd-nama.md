Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
