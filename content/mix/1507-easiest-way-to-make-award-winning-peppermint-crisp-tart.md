Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
