How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
