Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
