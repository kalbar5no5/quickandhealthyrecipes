Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
