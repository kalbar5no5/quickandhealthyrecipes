Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
