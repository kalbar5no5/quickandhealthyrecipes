Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
