How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
