Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
