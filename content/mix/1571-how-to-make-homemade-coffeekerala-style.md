Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.
