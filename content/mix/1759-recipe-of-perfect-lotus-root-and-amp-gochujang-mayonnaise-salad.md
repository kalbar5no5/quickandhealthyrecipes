Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk.

The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible!
