Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
