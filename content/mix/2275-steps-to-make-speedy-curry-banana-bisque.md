How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
