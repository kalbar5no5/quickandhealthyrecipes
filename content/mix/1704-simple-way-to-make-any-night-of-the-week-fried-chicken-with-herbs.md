Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
