How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
