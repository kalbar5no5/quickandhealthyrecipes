How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
