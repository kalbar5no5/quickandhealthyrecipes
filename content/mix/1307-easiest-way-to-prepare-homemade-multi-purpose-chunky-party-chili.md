Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
