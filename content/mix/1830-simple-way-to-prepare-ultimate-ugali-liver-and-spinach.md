Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
