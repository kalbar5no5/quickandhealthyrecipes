Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
