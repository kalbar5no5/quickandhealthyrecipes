Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
