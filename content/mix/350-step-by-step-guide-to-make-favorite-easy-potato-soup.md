Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
