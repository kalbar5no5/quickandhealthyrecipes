Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
