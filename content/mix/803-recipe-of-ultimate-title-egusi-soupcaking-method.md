Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.
