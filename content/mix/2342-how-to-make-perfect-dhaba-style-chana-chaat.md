Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
