Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
