Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
