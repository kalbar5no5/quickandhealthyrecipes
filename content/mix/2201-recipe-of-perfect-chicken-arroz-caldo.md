Arroz Caldo (Chicken Rice Porridge) Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Food Styling by Olivia Mack Anderson When my mother was a child, arroz caldo was just the thing for someone when they were sick.

Redolent of ginger, and served with a sunny array of condiments such as Calamansi, boiled eggs, and crisp garlic, this classic comfort food is the perfect way to brighten up a dreary day, while warming you up from the inside out. Arroz caldo is a hearty Filipino congee made with chicken and rice and seasoned with onion, garlic, ginger, and fish sauce and topped with crunchy fried garlic. The result is a quick, comforting bowl that&#39;s a perfect wintertime meal (and rivals chicken soup for its ability to sooth those suffering from a cold). Why this recipe works: Filipino Chicken Arroz Caldo is best consumed during cold weather. It is perfect during winter, or during chilly rainy days. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
