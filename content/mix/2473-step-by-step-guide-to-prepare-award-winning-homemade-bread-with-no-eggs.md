Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
