Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
