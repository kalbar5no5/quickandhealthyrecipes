Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
