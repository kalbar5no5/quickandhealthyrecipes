Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
