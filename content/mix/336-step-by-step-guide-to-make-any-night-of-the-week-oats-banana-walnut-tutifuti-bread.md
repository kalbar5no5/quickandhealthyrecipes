Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
