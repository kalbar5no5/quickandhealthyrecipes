Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
