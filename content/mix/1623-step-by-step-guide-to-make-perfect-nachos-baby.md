Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
