Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
