Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
