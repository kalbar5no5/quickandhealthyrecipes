Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
