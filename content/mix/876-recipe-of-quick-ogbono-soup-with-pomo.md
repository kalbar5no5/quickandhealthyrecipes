Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
