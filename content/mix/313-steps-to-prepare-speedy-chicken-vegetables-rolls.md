Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
