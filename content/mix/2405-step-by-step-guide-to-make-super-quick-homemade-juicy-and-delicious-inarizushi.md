Aburaage, the tofu skins which have been fried to form hollow products are used as containers which hold the rice together. Inarizushi is a very casual food and a perfect lunch for picnics because it&#39;s best eaten right from your hands. Aburaage is tofu skin that is deep fried, and used in many forms in Japanese cuisine. It has a slightly spongy texture. Because it&#39;s deep fried, it can be pretty greasy, so it&#39;s often prepared boiled in hot water first. 

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
