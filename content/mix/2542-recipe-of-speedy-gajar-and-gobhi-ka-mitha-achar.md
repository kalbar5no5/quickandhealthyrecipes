Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
