Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
