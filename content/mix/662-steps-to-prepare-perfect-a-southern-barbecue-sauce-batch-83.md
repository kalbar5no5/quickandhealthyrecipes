Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
