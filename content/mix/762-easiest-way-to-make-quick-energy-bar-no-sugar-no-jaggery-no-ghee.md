Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
