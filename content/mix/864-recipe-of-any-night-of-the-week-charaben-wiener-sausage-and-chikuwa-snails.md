Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
