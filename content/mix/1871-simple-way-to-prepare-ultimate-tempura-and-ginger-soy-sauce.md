In this recipe I added a number of commonly used ingredients to deep fry. Choose your favourite meat, vegetables, seafood or fish to deep fry. Of course fresh produce will always taste better but you can use frozen as. Tempura is a Japanese dish where seafood and vegetables are coated in a cold batter and then deep-fried. It is most often served with a tentsuyu dipping sauceâ€”this is made from dashi soup, mirin, and soy sauce. 

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
