Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
