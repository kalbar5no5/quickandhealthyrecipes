We use Tapered Eval, a technique used in evaluation to make a smooth transition between the phases of the game. At the moment I use SF on a GUI (Lucas Chess) but I want to start running it on the command line instead (to compare performances). How often do you eat stockfish? 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
