Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
