![Nyonya Fish Head Curry](https://img-global.cpcdn.com/recipes/6c59b8527a5055a2/751x532cq70/nyonya-fish-head-curry-recipe-main-photo.jpg)

Hello everybody, it's me again, Dan, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, nyonya fish head curry. One of my favorites. For mine, I'm gonna make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

In most western countries, fish heads are not readily available. It is not a problem to cook using a whole fish (cut into three parts).

Nyonya Fish Head Curry is one of the most well liked of recent trending meals on earth. It is easy, it is quick, it tastes yummy. It's enjoyed by millions every day. They are nice and they look wonderful. Nyonya Fish Head Curry is something that I have loved my whole life.

Then add in the fish head and vegetables and cover with a lid. This Curry Fish Head recipe is essentially a Nyonya ikan tumis recipe, but made with Garoupa fish head so I would call this a Nyonya Curry Fish Head as there is no curry powder and curry leaf used. Fish head curry is a soupy dish made by braising a fish head in a coconut milk soup base, flavoured with an aromatic curry spice paste, tamarind juices and seasonings. This really is a wholesome meal in and of itself, as fresh cut vegetables like egg plant, lady fingers and tomatoes, are added and stewed with the fish head in the curry. Fish head curry is a dish of relative popularity amongst Malaysians and Singaporeans and tourists there, although it is generally not categorised as cheap hawker fare. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
