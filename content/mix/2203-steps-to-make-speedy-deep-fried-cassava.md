Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
