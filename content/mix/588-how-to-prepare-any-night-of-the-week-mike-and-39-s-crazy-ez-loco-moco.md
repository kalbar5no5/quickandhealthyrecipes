recipeinstructions:
- "Here&#39;s all you&#39;ll need!"
- "Regardless of the amount of rice you&#39;ll be needing - run cold water over your uncooked rice in a tight mesh strainer until water runs clear. Or, place in your pot and rinse until water runs clear. Allow rice to fully drain."
- "In a pot with a tight fitting lid and thick bottom - bring 2 cups water, 1 cup rice and 1 teaspoon oil or butter to a hard boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer rice for 15 minutes or until water dissipates. Don&#39;t peek and lift your lid! Remove from heat and let sit for 5 minutes covered.                                                                                                                                                                                                         째 Authors Note: This is a minimal amount of rice and will usually make about 3 cups cooked rice. If you&#39;ll be needing more rice - double this or just follow manufactures directions. I&#39;ll also add a tablespoon dried onions in the rice pot if I have them on hand."
- "Season your beef patties with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder as you wish on both sides."
- "Place a small amount of oil in a frying pan with lid. Cook patties until done. Pierce the center. If you see any pink or red juices - fry longer but don&#39;t over cook."
- "Drain your patties on a clean paper towel."
- "In a clean frying pan - add fresh oil and fry eggs over easy to sunny side up with salt and pepper. You&#39;ll want your yolks runny to be authentic. Dab oil from fried eggs."
- "Mix your 2 McCormick Brown Gravy packets with 2 cups water [or, slightly less water if you want a thicker gravy] in a small pot while frying your eggs. Stir gravy constantly, bring to a boil and remove gravy from heat. You&#39;ll want to make your gravy last as a thick skin will form on the top of it rather quickly."
- "Pack your rice tightly in a ramekin with a spoon and gently flip over to release from the bowl. Or, you can simply pile rice on a plate un-molded. It&#39;s your choice. Pour gravy over the top of your rice, place patty on top of rice, cover with gravy and place egg on top. Garnish as you desire!                                                                               째 Garnishes pictured are dried chives and two types of fresh parsley. Serve with extra warm brown gravy on the side. Enjoy!"

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
