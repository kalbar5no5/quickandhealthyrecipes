How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
