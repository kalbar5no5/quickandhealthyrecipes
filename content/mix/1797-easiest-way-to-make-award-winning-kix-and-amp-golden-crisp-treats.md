Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
