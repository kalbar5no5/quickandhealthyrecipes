recipeinstructions:
- "Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat."
- "When oil is hot (surface looks shimmery), add onion, celery, and carrots. Season with salt. Some liquid will cook out of the celery; this is normal. Cook vegetables, stirring occasionally with a spatula, until the onion begins to turn translucent and the liquid has cooked off."
- "Add the garlic and continue cooking until the garlic begins to brown. Remove skillet from heat. Transfer vegetables to a large soup pot."
- "Break up ground beef into skillet. Season with salt, black pepper, and Worcestershire sauce. Return to heat."
- "Scramble ground beef over medium high heat until browned."

- "Add both cans of beans (drained), tomatoes (undrained), potatoes, and frozen vegetables to soup pot."
- "Add beef stock to soup pot. (You can also substitute water and beef bullion for stock. Use 1 cube bullion per quart of water.) Add bay leaves and Worcestershire sauce."
- "Bring soup to a boil over high heat, then turn heat down so that soup simmers but doesn&#39;t boil."
- "While soup is simmering, add chili powder and cumin. Adjust seasoning (salt, chili powder, cumin, etc.) to taste. You might need more salt than you think because the potatoes absorb quite a bit while they cook."
- "Let the soup simmer until the potatoes are tender and just starting to break down. (You can tell they are breaking down when the edges start to look rounded-off instead of sharp.) If you need to add water while the soup cooks, heat water to boiling in the microwave first and *carefully* add to the soup pot."
- "Remove bay leaves before serving."
- "If desired, crumble a handful of tortilla chips in the bottom of a soup bowl and ladel soup over them. Top with shredded cheese. Enjoy!"

So today I am sharing a quick and easy Southwest Beef and Black Bean soup recipe with you. It is so lean it does not require any draining of fat. You can use any kind of Stewed tomatoes, I like the Rotel because of the extra spice and flavor. I decided to replace the barley with white beans since they usually add the same kind of creaminess to dishes similar to what barley tends to give this soup. In a skillet over medium heat, cook beef until no longer pink; drain. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
