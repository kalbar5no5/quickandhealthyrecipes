Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
