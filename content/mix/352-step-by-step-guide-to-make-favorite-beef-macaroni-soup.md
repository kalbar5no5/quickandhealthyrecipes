Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
