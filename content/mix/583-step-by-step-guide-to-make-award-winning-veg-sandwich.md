Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
