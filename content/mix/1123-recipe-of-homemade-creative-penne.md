Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
