Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
