Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine.
