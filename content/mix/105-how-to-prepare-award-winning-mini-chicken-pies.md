Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
