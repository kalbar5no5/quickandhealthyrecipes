Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
