Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
