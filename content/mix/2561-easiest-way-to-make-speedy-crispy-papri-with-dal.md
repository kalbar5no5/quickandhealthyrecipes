Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
