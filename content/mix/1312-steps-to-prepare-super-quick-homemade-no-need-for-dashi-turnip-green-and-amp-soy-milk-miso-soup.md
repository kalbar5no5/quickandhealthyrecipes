Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
