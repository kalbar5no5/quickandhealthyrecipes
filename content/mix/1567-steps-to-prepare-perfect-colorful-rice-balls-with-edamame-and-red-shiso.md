Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
