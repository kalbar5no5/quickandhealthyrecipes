Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
