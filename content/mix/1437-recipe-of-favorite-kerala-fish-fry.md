Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
