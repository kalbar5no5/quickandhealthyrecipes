Combining the pulsations of the gizzard with accumulated grit and food acts as a grinding mechanism. Pour in more water during simmering, if needed, to keep gizzards covered. The gizzard is therefore one of the two stomachs a chicken has. It grinds, or &#34;chews&#34; food with small stones or grit before passing it back to the other stomach. Animals with this digestive system are able to eat a wide variety of food, from seeds and fruits, to small insects and meats from larger animals. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
