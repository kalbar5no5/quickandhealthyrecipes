How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
