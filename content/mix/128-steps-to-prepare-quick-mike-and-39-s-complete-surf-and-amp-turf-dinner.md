Wanted to take my two college-aged daughters surfing as one of our big activities for the trip, but had some difficulty booking through the resort and thought it just wasn&#39;t meant to be. Fortunately, we received a recommendation for Mike&#39;s Surf School from the manager at Seven. We provide each participant with the surf/sup board a leash and a rash guard. We are a licensed, insured and permitted surf school on the north shore of Oahu.

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
