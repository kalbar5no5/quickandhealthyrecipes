Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
