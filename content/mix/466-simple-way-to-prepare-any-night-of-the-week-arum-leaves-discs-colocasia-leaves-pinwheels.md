Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
