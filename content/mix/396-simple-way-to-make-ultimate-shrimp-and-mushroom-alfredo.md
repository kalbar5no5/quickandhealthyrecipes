Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
