Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
