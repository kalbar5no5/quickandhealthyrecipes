Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
