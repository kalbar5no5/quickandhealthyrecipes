Rub steaks with oil and season generously with sea salt and pepper. A ribeye steak tastes great simply seasoned with salt and pepper, but it can also stand up to stronger flavors. Cutting a garlic clove in half and rubbing the cut side all over the steak will add a little garlicky flavor to your steak without the danger of minced garlic burning in the pan. Properly pan-frying a ribeye is easy if you follow a few simple steps. If you&#39;d like that delicious char and caramelization to form, and some great juices to flow, pan frying it produces great results. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
