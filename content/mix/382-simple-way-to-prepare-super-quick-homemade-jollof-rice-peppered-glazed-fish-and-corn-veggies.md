Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
