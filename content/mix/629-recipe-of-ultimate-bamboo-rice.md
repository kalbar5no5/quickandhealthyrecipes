Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
