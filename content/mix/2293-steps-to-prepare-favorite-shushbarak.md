Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood.

The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body.
