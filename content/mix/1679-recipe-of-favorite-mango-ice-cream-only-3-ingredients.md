Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
