Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
