Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
