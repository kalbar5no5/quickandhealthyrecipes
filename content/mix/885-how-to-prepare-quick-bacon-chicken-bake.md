Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
