How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body.
