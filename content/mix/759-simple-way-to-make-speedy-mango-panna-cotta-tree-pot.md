Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!
