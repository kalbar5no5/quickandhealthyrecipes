Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
