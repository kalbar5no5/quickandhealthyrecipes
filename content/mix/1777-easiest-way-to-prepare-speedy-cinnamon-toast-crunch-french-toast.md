Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
