Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
