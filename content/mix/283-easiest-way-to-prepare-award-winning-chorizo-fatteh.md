Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
