Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
