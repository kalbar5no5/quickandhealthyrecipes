Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
