Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
