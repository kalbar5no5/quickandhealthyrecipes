Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
