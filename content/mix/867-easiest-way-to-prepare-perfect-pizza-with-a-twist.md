Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
