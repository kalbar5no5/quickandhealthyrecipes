Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
