Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
