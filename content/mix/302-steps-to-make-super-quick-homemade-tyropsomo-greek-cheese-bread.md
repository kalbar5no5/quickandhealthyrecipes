Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
