Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
