Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
