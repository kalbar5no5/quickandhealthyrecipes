recipeinstructions:
- "The first thing to do, which you&#39;ll want to do a bit in advance is to whisk together all the marinade ingredients in a small bowl or a measuring cup. Set aside about half of it to season the veggies with. Then place the chicken either in a large, shallow bowl or a gallon sized Ziploc bag and pour the rest of the marinade over the top of it. Coat the chicken really well, then cover the bowl and set it in the fridge to marinate for at least 30 or so minutes."
- "Preheat the oven to 425째F. Line a large baking tray or roasting pan with foil and grease it. Set it aside."
- "While the chicken marinates, you can begin prepping your veggies. I just chop the potatoes in half if they&#39;re small, in quarters if they&#39;re on the bigger side. Then peel and chop the carrots into larger, diagonal pieces. Leave the garlic as whole, unpeeled cloves. Toss all of the veggies, except for the garlic, with the set aside marinade."
- "Take the chicken out of the marinade and set it onto the prepared baking tray. Arrange all of the veggies around and between the chicken. Just place the garlic in different spots nestled into the veggies."
- "Bake for about 35-45 or so minutes, or until the veggies are fork tender and the chicken is at an internal temperature of 165째F. Remove it from the oven and grate some parmesan cheese over the top of it all (optional but delicious)."
- "Serve immediately and enjoy! Refrigerate any leftovers."

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
