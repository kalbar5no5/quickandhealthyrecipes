Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
