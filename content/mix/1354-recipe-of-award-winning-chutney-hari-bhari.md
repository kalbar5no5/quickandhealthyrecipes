Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
