Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
