Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them.
