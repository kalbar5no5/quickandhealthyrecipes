Other wild mushrooms will work quite well.

In Italy, risotto ai funghi, or Mushroom Risotto, is often made with fresh porcini mushrooms in season, but porcini can be hard to find elsewhere—and are always very expensive. Other wild mushrooms will work quite well. You can easily add cooked meat or vegetables to this risotto to make it a main dish. Try gently cooked asparagus, peas, mushrooms, or sausage. Enjoy this dish with a fresh and crisp green salad dressed with a simple vinaigrette. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
