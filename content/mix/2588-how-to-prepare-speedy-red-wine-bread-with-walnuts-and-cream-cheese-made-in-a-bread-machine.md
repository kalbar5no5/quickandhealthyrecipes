Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
