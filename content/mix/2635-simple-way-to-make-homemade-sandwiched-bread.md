How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
