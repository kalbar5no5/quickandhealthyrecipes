In a large bowl whisk together the flour, sugar, baking soda and salt. In another bowl combine the mashed bananas, egg, oil, buttermilk, and vanilla. One extra thing to look out for when cooking bread in a toaster oven is not only that the circumference of the bread will fit the oven but that the height will as well. Keep in mind that if everything goes according to plan, your loaf will rise as it cooks, and could hit the top of the oven unexpectedly. If you mostly plan on using your toaster oven for bread and heating foods, a compact model is sufficient. 

Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
