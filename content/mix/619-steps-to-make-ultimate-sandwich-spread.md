Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts.

The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving!
