Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
