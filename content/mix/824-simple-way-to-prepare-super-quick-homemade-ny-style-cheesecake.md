I baked Lucinda&#39;s New York Style cheesecake for yesterday&#39;s Christmas Dinner and it was absolutely delicious. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t butter the bottom well enough so the crust stuck just slightly. Next time I will take the suggestion of a previous reviewer and use parchment round on the bottom also. Run a thin metal knife along the sides of the springform pan, then unlock the pan and slip the side section up and over the cheesecake.

Next time I will take the suggestion of a previous reviewer and use parchment round on the bottom also. Run a thin metal knife along the sides of the springform pan, then unlock the pan and slip the side section up and over the cheesecake. Run a knife under hot water, dry it quickly, then slide it from left to right between the bottom of the pan and the bottom of the cake. Slide the cake to a cake liner or platter. Standard cheesecake recipes are maybe an inch or two thick, but New York-style is often double that. 

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
