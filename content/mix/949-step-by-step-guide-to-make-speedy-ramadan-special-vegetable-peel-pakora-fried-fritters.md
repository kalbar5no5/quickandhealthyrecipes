Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
