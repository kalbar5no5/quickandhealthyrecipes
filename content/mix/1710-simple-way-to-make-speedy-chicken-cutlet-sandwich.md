Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
