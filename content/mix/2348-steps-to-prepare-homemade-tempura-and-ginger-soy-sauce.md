In this recipe I added a number of commonly used ingredients to deep fry. Choose your favourite meat, vegetables, seafood or fish to deep fry. Of course fresh produce will always taste better but you can use frozen as. Tempura is a Japanese dish where seafood and vegetables are coated in a cold batter and then deep-fried. It is most often served with a tentsuyu dipping sauceâ€”this is made from dashi soup, mirin, and soy sauce. 

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
