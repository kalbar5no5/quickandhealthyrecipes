Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
