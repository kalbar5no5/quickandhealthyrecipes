Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
