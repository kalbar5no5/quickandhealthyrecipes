Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
