I used cresecent rolls instead of piecrust. This chicken pot pie recipe is loaded with flavor. It&#39;s got flaky pie crust and a buttery creamy chicken pot pie filling with chicken breast, a mix of fresh and I initially wanted to make an easy chicken pot pie. So, I started out using refrigerated pie dough, all frozen vegetables, and all dried herbs. This from-scratch Chicken Pot Pie is adapted from Marshall Field&#39;s classic recipe. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
