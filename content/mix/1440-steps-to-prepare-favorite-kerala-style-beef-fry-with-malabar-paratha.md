Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
