Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
