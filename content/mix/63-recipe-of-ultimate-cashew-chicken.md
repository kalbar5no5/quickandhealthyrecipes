Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
