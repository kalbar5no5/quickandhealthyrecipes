Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
