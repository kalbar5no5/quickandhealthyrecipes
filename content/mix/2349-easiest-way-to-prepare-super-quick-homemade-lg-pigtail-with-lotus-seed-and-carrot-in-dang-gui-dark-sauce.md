Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
