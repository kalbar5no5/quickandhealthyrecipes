Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
