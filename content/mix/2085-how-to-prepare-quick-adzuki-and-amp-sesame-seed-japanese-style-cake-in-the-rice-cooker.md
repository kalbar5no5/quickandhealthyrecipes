Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
