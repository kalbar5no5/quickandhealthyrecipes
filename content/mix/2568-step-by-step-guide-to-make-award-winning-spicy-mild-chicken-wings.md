Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
