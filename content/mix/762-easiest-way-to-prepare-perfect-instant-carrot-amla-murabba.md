Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
