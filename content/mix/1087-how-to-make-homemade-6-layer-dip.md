Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
