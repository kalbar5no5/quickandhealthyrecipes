Grandma&#39;s Old Fashioned Chicken Soup The reason why I call this &#34;old-fashioned&#34; chicken soup is because nowadays, with the advent of so many tinned, packet and dehydrated versions of soups, taking the time in today&#39;s busy fast paced life to cook an old-fashioned recipe which can take a couple of hours, is not something everyone is. Grandma&#39;s Chicken Noodle Soup is loaded with a deep flavorful broth, tender chicken, and loads of delicious thick Grandma&#39;s Noodles. That&#39;s why we call it Grandma&#39;s Soup. Growing up the only &#34;Chicken Noodle&#34; Soup I ever had was Campbell&#39;s.

That&#39;s why we call it Grandma&#39;s Soup. Growing up the only &#34;Chicken Noodle&#34; Soup I ever had was Campbell&#39;s. I remember slurping those squiggly wormy noodles through the small opening left by a lost tooth. Place the chicken, water, bouillon, peppercorns and cloves in a stockpot. Cover and bring to a boil; skim foam. 

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
