Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
