Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
