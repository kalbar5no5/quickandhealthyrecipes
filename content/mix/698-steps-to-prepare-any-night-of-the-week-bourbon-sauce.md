If you want the original recipe for the Bourbon Chicken you can find it at the link I provided. Buttery sweet honey sauce, with a touch of bourbon and vanilla is perfect for topping just about anything from breads to ice cream to veggies. I think I found a new favorite sauce. Our Bourbon Barbecue Sauce is a terrific blend of flavors from the bourbon, ketchup, tomato paste, balsamic vinegar, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, and a small amount of hickory liquid smoke. Bourbon isn&#39;t just any whiskey, there are specific requirements which have to be met by the distiller in order for him / her to call their whiskey Bourbon. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
