Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
