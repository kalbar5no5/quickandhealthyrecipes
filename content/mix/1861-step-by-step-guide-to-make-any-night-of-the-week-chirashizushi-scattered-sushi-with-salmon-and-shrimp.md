Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
