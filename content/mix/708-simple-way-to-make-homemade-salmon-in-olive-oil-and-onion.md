Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
