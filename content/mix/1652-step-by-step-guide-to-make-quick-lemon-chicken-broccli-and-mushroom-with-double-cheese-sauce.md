Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
