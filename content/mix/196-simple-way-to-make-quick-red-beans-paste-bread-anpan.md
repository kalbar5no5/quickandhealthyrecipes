Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
