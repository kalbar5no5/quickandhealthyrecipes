Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
