Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
