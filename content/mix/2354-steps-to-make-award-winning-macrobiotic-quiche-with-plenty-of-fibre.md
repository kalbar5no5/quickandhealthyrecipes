Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
