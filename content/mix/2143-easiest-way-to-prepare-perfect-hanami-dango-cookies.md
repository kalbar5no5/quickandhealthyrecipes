Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
