Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
