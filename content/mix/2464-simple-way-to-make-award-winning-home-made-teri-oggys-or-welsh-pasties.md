Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
