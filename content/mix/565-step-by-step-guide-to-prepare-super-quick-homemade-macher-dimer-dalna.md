Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
