Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
