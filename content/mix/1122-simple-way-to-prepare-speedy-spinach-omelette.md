Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
