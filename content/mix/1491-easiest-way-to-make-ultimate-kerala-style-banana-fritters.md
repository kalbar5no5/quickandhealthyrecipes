Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
