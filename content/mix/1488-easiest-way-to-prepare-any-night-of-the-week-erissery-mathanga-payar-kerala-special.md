Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
