Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
