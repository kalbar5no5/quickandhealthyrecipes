Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
