Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
