Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
