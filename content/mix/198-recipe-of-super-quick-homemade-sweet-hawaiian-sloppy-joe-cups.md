Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
