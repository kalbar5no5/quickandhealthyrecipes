Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
