Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
