How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
