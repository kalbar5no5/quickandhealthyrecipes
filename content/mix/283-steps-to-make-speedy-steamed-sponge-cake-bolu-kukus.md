Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
