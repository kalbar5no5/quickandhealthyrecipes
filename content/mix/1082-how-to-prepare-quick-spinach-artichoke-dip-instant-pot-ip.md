Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
