Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
