Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
