Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
