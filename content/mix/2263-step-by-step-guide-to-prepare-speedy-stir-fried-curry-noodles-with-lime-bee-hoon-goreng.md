Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine.
