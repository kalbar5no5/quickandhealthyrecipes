Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body.
