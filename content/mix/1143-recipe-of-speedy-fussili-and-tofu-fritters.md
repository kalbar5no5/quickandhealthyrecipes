Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
