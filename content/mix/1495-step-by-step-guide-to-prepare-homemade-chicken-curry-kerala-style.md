Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
