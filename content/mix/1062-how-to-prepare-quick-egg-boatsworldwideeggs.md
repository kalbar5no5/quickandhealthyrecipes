Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
