Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
