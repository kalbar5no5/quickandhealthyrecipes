Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
