Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
