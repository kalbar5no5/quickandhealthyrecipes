Boondi is small pearls of Chickpea flour which are deep-fried in oil till crispy and crunchy. When added in yogurt, these soak up the liquid and becomes soft. Boondi is available in most Indian stores and it comes in a variety of flavors like mint, masala, etc. I prefer to use plain boondi to make Raita and add the masalas in the yogurt.

Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
