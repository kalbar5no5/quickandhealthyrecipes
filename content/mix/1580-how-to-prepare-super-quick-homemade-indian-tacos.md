How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
