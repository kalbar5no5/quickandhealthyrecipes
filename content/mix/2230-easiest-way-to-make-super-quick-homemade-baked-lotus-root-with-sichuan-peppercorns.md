Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
