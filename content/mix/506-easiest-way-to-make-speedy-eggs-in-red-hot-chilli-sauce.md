Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
