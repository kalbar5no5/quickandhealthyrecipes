Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
