How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
