Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
