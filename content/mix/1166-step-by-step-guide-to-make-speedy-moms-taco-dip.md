Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
