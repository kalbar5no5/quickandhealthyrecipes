Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
