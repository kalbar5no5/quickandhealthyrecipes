Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
