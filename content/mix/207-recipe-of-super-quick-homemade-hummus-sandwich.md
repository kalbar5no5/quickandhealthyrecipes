Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
