Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
