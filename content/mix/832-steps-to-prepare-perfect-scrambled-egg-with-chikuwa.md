Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
