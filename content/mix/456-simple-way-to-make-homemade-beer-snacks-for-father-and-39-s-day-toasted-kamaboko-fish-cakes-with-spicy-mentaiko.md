Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
