Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
