Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
