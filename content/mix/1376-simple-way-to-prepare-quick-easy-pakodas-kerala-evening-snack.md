Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
