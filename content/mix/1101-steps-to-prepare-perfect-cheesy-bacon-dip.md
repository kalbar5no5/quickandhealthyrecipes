Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
