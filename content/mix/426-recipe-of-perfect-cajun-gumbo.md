recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the shrimp and set aside in the refrigerator. Take the shells / tails and place them in a small pot. Add the water and Old Bay seasoning to the pot and bring to a boil."

- "Prepare the vegetables; place them all in a bowl, and set aside."
- "Season the chicken. Add oil to a large pan and cook the chicken 15 minutes per side on medium heat. Remove them from the pan and allow them to cool."
- "In the same pan, add the sausage and brown 5 minutes per side. Remove from pan and allow it to cool."
- "Pour off the oil in the pan to measure about 1/2 cup. Add butter to the pan and begin to melt. Add the measured oil to the pan and heat over medium-high heat until slightly smoking. Gradually whisk in 1/2 cup flour."

- "Reduce the heat to low-medium and stir in the garlic, all seasonings, and sauces. Remove the chicken meat from the bones, roughly chop the meat, and place in the pot. [Discard the skin and bones] Cut the sausage up in 1/2” pieces and add them to the pot."
- "Add the green onions (white parts) and simmer for 50 minutes, stirring occasionally. After the long simmer, raise the heat to medium, add the okra, and cook for 15 minutes. The stock will thicken a bit more."
- "Reduce the heat to low, add the refrigerated shrimp and parsley, stir a few times, and cook until the shrimp begins to turn a slight pink. [Add filé powder at this point if not using okra] Turn off the heat; allow this to rest, while preparing the rice."
- "To serve, place a cup of cooked rice into a round mini-cup. Invert the cup of rice into the center of a plate or bowl (with low sides). Ladle the gumbo all around the mounded rice and garnish with parsley. Repeat for other serving bowls."
- "Serve and enjoy with some crusty bread or cornbread."

Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
