Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
