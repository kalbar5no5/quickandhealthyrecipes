Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
