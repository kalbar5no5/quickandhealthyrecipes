Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
