How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
