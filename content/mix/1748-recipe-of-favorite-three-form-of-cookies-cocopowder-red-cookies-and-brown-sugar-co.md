Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
