Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
