Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
