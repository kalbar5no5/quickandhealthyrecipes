Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
