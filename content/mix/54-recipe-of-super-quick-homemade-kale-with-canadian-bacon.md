Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
