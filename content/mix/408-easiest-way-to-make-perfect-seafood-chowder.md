Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
