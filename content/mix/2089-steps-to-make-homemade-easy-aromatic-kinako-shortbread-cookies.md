Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
