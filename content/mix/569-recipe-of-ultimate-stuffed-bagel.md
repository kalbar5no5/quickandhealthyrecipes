Each Stuffed Bagel Mini is a little larger than a golf ball, so that&#39;s at least two to three bites worth of bagel goodness. The bagels come two to an order, which is perfect for snacking, but if you&#39;re really hungry or want to make a full meal of them, you might want to snag two orders. While the bagel balls are resting, bring your poaching liquid ingredients to a boil over medium heat.

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
