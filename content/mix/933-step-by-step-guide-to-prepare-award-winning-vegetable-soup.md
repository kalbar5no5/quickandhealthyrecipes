Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
