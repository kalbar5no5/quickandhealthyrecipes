Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
