Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
