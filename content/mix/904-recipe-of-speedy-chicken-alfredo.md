Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
