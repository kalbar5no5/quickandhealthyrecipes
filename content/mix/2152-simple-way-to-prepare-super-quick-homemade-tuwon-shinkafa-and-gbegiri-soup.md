Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
