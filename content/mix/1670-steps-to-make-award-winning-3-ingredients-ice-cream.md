Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
