Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
