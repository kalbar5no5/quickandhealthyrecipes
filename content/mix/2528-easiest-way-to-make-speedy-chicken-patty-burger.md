Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
