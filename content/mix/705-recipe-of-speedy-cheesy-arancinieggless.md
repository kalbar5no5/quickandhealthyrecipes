I have long been a lover of arancini, but I hate deep-frying foods. Not just because of the health factors, I just really hate waste, and I feel like too much oil is wasted when foods are deep-fried. So I decided to make some cheesy rice balls, otherwise known as arancini, different from the way I have had it before - I baked it. They are simply perfection - a soft, slightly cheesy and risotto-filled centered PLUS a crisp, herby and lightly breaded exterior.

So I decided to make some cheesy rice balls, otherwise known as arancini, different from the way I have had it before - I baked it. They are simply perfection - a soft, slightly cheesy and risotto-filled centered PLUS a crisp, herby and lightly breaded exterior. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic, and cook, stirring until onion is soft but not browned. First, you&#39;ll start with a classic sofrito: Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
