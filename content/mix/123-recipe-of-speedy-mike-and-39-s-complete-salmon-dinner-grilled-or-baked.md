Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
