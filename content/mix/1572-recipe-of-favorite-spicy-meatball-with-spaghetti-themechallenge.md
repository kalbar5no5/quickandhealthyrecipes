How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
