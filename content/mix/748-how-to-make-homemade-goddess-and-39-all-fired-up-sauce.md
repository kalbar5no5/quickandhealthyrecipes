Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
