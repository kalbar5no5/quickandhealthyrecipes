Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
