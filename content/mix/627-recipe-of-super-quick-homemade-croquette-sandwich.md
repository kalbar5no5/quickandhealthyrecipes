Korokke is the Japanese form of the French word croquette, which describes a snack made from a filling such as meat or fish, bound together with a thickened sauce, formed into cylinders, breaded, and deep-fried. So &#34;Korokke Pan&#34; essentially means &#34;croquette bread,&#34; which may sound familiar to long-time readers of the site. Literally meaning &#34;mister crunch,&#34; the croque monsieur is a treasure trove of textures; pop a fried egg on top of your sandwich to transform it into a croque madame.

Literally meaning &#34;mister crunch,&#34; the croque monsieur is a treasure trove of textures; pop a fried egg on top of your sandwich to transform it into a croque madame. The croque monsieur is a classic French sandwich made with ham and cheese. Transfer to a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining butter and sandwiches. Like a hot ham and cheese sandwich, but slathered with cream sauce and baked to bubbly perfection. (Yeah, it&#39;s as good as it sounds.) In France, the croque monsieur is traditionally served as a bar. Heat a skillet over medium heat. 

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
