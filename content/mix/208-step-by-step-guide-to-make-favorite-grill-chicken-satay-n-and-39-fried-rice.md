Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
