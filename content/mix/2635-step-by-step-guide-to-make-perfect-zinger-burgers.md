Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
