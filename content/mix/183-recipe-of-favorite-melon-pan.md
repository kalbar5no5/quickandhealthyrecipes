Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
