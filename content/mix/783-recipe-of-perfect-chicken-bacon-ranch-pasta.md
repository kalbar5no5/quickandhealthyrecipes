Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
