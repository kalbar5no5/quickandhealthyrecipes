Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
