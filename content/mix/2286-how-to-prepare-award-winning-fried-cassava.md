Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
