Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
