Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
