Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
