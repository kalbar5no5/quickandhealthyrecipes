Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
