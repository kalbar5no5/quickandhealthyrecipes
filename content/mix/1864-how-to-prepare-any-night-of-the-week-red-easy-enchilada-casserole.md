Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
