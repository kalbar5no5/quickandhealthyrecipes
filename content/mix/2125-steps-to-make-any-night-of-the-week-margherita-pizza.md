Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
