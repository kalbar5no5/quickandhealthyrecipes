Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
