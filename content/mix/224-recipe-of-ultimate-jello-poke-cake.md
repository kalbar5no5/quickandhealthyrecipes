Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
