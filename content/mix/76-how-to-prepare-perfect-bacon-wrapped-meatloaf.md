Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
