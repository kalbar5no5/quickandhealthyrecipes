recipeingredient:
- "10 Aburaage for the inari sushi"
- "5 tbsp  Sugar"
- "5 tbsp  Sake"
- "5 tbsp  Water"
- "4 tbsp  Soy sauce"
- "4 tbsp  Mirin"
- "700 grams White rice"
- "30 ml Sushi vinegar"
- "1 to 2 tablespoons Toasted white sesame seeds"
- "50 grams Lotus roots"
- "4 Saltpreserved cherry blossoms"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the lotus roots into about 1 cm square slices. Boil them in hot water with some vinegar and sugar (not on the recipe ingredients) for just about 3 minutes to keep their texture. Transfer the lotus roots and the soup in a bowl and cool it down."
- "Put all the ☆ ingredients and the aburaage in a pot. Put a small drop lid  and let it simmer for a while.  (I use a makeshift drop lid by poking holes in a circular sheet of parchment paper)"
- "Put all the ☆ ingredients and the aburaage into a pot. Place on a small drop lid  and let it simmer for a while. (I make some holes on a cooking sheet and use it as a drop lid.)"
- "Simmer it until golden brown. Drain a little bit of the seasoning sauce away but not completely. (It can dry out if you drain away too much.)"
- "Wash the salted cherry-blossoms in water quickly and soak them in water for about 15 minutes to take out the salt. Break apart the cherry-blossoms and drain them with a paper towel."
- "Put the rice in a bowl when the rice is ready, sprinkle some vinegar, mix it like you are cutting it with a rice scoop, and let it cool down. Add the lotus roots, cherry-blossoms and white sesame seeds too and mix."
- "Stuff the rice from Step 8 into the aburaage from Step 9. Stuff the rice gently after stuffing the corners of the aburaage as you open up them so that they look nice and plump but keep their softness. Fold in the open side and you&#39;re all done."
- "*Using red ginger pickles and nozawana would also give your rice a beautiful color."
- "If you keep the boiled lotus roots in the juice of red pickled ginger in some sugar overnight, they&#39;ll become pink as well."
- "&#34;Beautiful Forever! Salted Cherry-Blossom (in Plum Vinegar)&#34; would be a good choice for the cherry blossoms. You can of course use store-bought ones."

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
