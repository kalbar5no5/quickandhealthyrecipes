Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
