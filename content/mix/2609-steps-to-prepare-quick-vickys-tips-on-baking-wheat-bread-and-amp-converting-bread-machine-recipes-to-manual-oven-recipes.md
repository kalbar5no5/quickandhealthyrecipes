Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
