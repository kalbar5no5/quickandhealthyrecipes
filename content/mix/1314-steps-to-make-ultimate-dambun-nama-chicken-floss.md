Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
