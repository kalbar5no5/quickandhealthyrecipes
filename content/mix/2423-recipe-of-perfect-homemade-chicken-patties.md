Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
