Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
