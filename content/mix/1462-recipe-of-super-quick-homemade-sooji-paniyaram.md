Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
