Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
