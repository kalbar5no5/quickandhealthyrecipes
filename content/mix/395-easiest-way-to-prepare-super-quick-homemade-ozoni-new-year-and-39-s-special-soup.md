Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
