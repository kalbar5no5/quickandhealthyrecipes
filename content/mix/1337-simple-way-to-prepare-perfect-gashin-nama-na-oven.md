Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
