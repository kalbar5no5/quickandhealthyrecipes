Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
