Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
