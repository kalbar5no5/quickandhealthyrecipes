Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
