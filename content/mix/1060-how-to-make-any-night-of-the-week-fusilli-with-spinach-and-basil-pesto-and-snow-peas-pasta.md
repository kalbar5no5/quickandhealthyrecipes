Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
