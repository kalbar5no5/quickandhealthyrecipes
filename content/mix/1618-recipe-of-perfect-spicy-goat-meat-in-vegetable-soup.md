Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
