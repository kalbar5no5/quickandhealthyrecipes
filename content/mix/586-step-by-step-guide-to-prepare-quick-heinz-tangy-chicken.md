Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
