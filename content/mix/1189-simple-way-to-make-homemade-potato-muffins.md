Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
