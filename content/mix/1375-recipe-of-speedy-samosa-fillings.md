I am sharing my favourite samosa filling recipe today. Samosa is a traditional dish from Uzbekistan. It is typically made with a flakey pastry dough and I&#39;ve tried making the samosas with different fillings and my family seems to enjoy the chicken and potato. Beef and potatoes are the main ingredients folded inside these wonderful deep fried samosas. Loved the filling, but thought the phyllo dough was unauthentic. 

Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
