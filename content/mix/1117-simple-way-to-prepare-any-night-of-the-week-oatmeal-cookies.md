Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
