Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
