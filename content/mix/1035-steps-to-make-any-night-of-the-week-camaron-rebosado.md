Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
