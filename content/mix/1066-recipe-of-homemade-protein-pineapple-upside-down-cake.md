Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
