Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
