Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
