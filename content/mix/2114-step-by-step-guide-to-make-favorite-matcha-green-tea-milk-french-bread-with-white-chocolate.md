Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
