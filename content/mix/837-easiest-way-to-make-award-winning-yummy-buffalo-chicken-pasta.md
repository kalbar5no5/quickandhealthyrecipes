Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
