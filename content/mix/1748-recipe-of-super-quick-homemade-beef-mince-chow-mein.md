Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
