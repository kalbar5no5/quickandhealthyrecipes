Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
