Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
