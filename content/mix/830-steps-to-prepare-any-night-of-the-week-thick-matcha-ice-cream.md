Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
