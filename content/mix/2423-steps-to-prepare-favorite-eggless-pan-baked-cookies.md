Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
