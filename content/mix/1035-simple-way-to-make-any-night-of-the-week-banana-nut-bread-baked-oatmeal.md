Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine.
