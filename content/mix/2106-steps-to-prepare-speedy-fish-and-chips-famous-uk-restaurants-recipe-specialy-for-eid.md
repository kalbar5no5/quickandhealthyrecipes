Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
