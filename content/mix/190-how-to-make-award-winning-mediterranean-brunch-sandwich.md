Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
