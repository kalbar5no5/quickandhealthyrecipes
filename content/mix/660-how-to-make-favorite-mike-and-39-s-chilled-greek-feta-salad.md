recipeingredient:
- " Greek Feta Salad"
- "1 box (12 oz) Multi Colored Rotini Pasta"
- "2 (8 oz) Boxes ATHENOS Feta Cheese Chunks 14 chop"
- "5 oz Shreadded Parmesan Cheese"
- "1/4 Cup Sun Dried Tomatoes in oil  chopped"
- "1 can Artichokes In Water drained  chopped"
- "1/2 large Red  Green  Yellow  Orange Bell Pepper chopped"
- "1 can Black Olives drained  sliced in half"
- "1 large Cucumber peeled  chopped"
- "1 (10.5 oz) Cherry Tomatoes sliced in half"
- "1/2 cup Chopped Green Onions"
- "1 Purple Onion chopped"
- "1/2 Bunch Fresh Parsley rough chop"
- "1 Fresh Cracked Black Pepper to taste"
- "2 tbsp Fresh Basil optional"
- "1 cup Banana Peppers optional"
- "2 (16 oz) Bottles Kraft Zesty Italian Dressing reserve one bottle"
recipeinstructions:
- "Clean, chop and drain all vegetables. Refrigerate until pasta is ready and cooled down."
- "Chop Feta Cheese chunks in semi large chunks and add to vegetables. They will fall apart slightly when mixed with the dressing."
- "Shred Parmesan Cheese if not already shreadded."
- "Bring a large pot of water to a steady boil and add 1/2 tsp salt and a splash of oil.  Pour pasta into boiling water, stirring occasionally and cover for 8 minutes. Or, as per box directions. I&#39;ll boil my noodles al dente [just under manufacturers directions] for a toothier chew."
- "Drain noodles and place pasta in a large bowl.  Immediately add your entire bottle of Italian Dressing to your pasta and mix well.   This step is important. Especially if you&#39;re serving this dish the same day. Your pasta will instantly begin to absorb your dressing while hot.  Allow pasta to cool naturally on the counter."
- "Also another great dressing option!"
- "After pasta has cooled off - add all of your chopped chilled vegetables and cheeses. Gently fold them in.  Refrigerate salad for several hours - gently mixing occasionally.  As needed - add your reserved bottle of dressing if you feel your salad is firming up too much with the addition of cheese."
- "Authors Notes:   #1: I&#39;ve tried the most expensive Italian Dressings and most of the more cost effective ones. One of the best I&#39;ve found to date is Kraft Zesty Italian for flavor and price.   #2: The flavor of this salad is exponentially better the following day.   #3: Stir entire batch of salad from the base upwards each time before serving dishes for best flavor.  Enjoy!"

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
