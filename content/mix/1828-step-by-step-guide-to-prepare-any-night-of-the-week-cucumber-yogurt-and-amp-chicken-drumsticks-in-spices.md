Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
