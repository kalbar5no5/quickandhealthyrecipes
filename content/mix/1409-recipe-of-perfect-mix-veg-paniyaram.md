Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
