Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
