How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
