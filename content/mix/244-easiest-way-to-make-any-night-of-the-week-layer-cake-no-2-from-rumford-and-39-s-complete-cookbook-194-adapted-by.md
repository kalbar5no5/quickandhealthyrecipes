Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
