##### Instructions to make Simple Egg Sandwich:

1. Heat small non stick skillet. Melt butter. I only use butter in nonstick pans. You can also use cooking spray.
1. When pan is hot crack both eggs into pan. They need to set a minute so this is when I pop my toast in the toaster.
1. Once the egg white is starting to get white use the corner of a spatula and break the yokes if not broken already. Add a dash of salt and pepper. Now is also when I use the spatula to start to form the two eggs into one. As the egg runs, use the spatula to keep it all together. You want it to be close to the size of your toast.
1. After 1 minute flip the egg. Slide it to the side of your pan to make room for the meat. Add the meat to the pan. Have tongs ready! The meat can fry up fast.
1. After the meat is in the pan flip the egg. Put your meat on, then cheese and let cook til cheese is melted. Toast should be ready!


After cheese has melted, place each egg on a toasted slice of bread. Season eggs with salt and pepper. Mix in mustard, relish and pepper. Put egg salad mixture on bread (toasted is good as well), also good on rolls for finger foods. An easy way to make an egg sandwich for breakfast! 

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
