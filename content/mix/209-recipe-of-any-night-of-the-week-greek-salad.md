How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
