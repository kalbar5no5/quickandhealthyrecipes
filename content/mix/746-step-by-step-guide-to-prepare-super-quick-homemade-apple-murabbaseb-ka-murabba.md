Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
