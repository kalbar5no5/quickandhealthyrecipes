Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
