Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
