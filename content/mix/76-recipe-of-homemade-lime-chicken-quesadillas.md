Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
