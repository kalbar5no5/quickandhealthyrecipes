Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
