Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
