How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
