Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
