Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
