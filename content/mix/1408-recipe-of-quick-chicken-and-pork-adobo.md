Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
