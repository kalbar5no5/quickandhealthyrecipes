Turn heat to the mid lower setting &amp; simmer for 25mins with lid on. Remove chicken from the pot &amp; let dry. Prepare ingredients. See pic. Use pure coconut milk. See pic. Many brands add xanthan gum, thickener &amp; many &#34;non-coconut&#34; extras in their canned coconut milk. Read label before buying canned coconut milk."
- "Blend ingredients in B with a bit of water until smooth &amp; pasty. Prepare ingredients in C with enough water to make a smooth curry paste. Heat wok/big pot with 1/2 cup of cooking oil. Add blended spices &amp; sauté until translucent &amp; aromatic. Add in curry paste. Keep stirring until aromatic for 5mins or more."
- "Next, add chicken broth to the wok/big pot. Stir or whisk to combine. Let boil. Meanwhile, prepare accompaniments - blanch fishball/fishcake &amp; yellow noodles or soften Vermicilli. Next, pour coconut milk into the wok/big pot of boiling broth. (Note: shake or whisk coconut milk in separate bowl as it curdle sometimes). Stir curried broth to mix. Taste &amp; adjust seasoning accordingly. It should be lightly strong as blanched noodle/vermicelli is tasteless. Simmer until it bubbles then Turn off heat."
- "Order to assemble - noodles/vermicelli, curried broth, chopped chicken, fish ball/fish cake, bean sprout. Serve hot. Assemble only before serving. Reheat curried broth (if necessary) just before serving. When reheating curried broth, turn off heat immediately right after broth just bubbled or boiled. Do not leave broth boiling too long as it has coconut milk that would turn oily when left boiling longer than necessary."

Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
