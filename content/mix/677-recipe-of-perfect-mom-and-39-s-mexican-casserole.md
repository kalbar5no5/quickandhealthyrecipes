Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
