Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
