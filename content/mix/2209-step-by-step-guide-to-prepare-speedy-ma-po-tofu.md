Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
