Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
