Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
