recipeinstructions:
- "A - Soaked noodle in boiling water for few seconds and drain. Use both vermicelli and yellow noodles or use only one. Boil chicken thighs with garlic and enough water to cover the flesh. Once boil, take out the chicken from the broth. Keep this chicken broth for later. Put aside. Blanch fish cakes. Keep aside."
- "B. CURRY LAKSA PASTE - Blend all ingredients in B with 1/4 C of water (or just enough water) to make laksa paste. Keep aside. Prepare chicken broth from A by removing garlic used to boil the chicken. Keep aside."
- "C. CURRY LAKSA BROTH - combine and mix meat curry powder with enough water to get a thick curry paste."
- "D. THE ACCOMPANIMENTS - prep all the accompaniments."
- "COOKING THE LAKSA - Heat the wok. Add 7 tbsp of oil. Add ingredient B (laksa paste) Sauté until fragrant for few minutes. Next, Add meat curry paste, stir again until oil is separated from the paste."
- "Add chicken stock. Note/tip: if, at all, you have prawn heads, use them to make laksa broth by boiling them. 1 bowl of prawn head + 1 bowl of water. Once boiled, blend the whole thing, then strain to get enough broth. Use this in place of chicken stock or use both. Prawn head stock is optional but it surely the secret ingredient that most restaurants use to have a very rich taste of their broth and soups. I sometimes use both stocks to make my laksa broth. Leave this broth to simmer."

- "Note: Sambal Paste is served with laksa but its totally optional as some find it a bit spicy. It’s prepared by blending until fine 2 cups of soaked and softened dried chillies, few fresh chilies, 1 shallots, 1 medium brown onion, 2 thumb size of shrimp paste or belacan, pinch of salt and 1/2 tsp of sugar. Next, it is then fried in enough oil until fragrant and almost dried. The sambal is done. Serve a teaspon or a tablespoon with a bowl of curry laksa noodle."
- "Season broth with chicken stock granules/powder. Taste and add salt if necessary. Now add coconut cream. Stir and simmer before switching off the heat. Once coconut cream is added, simmering only take a very short time. Once broth starts to near boil, turn the heat off immediately."
- "Assemble everything in a big soup bowl in this order- noodles, curry laksa soup/broth, then add in D. Anyway, dont forget to Slice the fish cake. Serve with slice of lime/lemon and CURRY LAKSA SAMBAL (NOTE: the one pictured in the spoon)"

Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
