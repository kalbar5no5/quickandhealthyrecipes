Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
