How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
