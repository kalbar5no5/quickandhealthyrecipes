Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
