Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
