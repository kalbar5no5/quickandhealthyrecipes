Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
