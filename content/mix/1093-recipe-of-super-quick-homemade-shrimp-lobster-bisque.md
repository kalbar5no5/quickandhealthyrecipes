How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
