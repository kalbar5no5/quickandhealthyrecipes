Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
