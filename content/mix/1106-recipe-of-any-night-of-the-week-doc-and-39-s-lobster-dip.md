Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
