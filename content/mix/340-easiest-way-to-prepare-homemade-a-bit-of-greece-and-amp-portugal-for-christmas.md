How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
