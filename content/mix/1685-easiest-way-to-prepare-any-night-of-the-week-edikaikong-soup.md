Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
