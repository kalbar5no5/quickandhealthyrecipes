Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
