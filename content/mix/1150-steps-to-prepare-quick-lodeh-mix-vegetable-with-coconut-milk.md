Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
