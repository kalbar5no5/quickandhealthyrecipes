- "8 slices toasted bread"
- "4 tablespoons mayo or miracle whip"
- "1 large tomatoe sliced"
- " Salt and pepper"
- " Lettuce you prefer I used iceberg"

recipeinstructions:
- "You can either bake your bacon (add 4 to 6 extra minutes to the cooking time for thick cut), or you can heat a skillet over medium heat and cook the bacon for about 6 to 8 minutes, turning it every few minutes until it is nicely crisp, but still pliable. Remove the bacon to paper towels to drain."
- "Over medium high heat fry 1 egg to over medium. You will need 1 egg per sandwich. If you dont know how to cook a over medium egg it is in my recipes."
- "Toast bread in toaster oven, skillet or oven. How to is in next step."
- "Spread about 1 teaspoon of mayonnaise on 1 side of each piece of bread. Spray a large skillet with nonstick cooking spray and heat over medium heat. In the skillet, place as many slices of bread that will fit, mayo side down, and griddle them up until the mayo side of the bread is nicely browned, about 1 minute. Remove the bread from the skillet, let rest browned side up, and griddle up any remaining slices."
- "Place 4 of the slices of toast browned side down on a cutting board. Place a tomato on each piece, season lightly with salt and pepper, place 4-6 slices of bacon on each slice of tomato, add cheese of your choice. Then add 1 over medium egg and top with a couple of pieces of lettuce. Generously spread the rest of the mayo on the non-browned side of the remaining slices of bread, and top the sandwiches with the second piece of bread. Slice in half and you&#39;re good to go."
- "More ideas to make your blt plus. You can add grilled or caramelized onions, or a thin slice of raw onion, swap out the plain lettuce for arugula or watercress, or a blend of lettuce. You can Change out the bacon for pancetta. You can add a slice of avocado or make a quick guac-ish mash smash up some avocado with lime juice and maybe some minced scallion or minced cilantro. Either addition is great or just make a classic blt. Bacon Lettuce Tomato sandwich."
- "Enjoy."

Tons of contrasting colors, flavors, and textures make a relatively simple sandwich a true gourmet delight. To pair with a BLT sandwich, I&#39;d go with a classic recipe with carrots, bell pepper, and celery. If you want yours to be a little sweet, stick with regular mayonnaise. Arrange lettuce on top, along with tomato and basil. Wife and I shared the BLT Plus and the Turkey and Brie sandwiches. 

Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
