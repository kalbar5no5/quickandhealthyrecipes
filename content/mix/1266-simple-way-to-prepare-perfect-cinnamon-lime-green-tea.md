Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
