Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
