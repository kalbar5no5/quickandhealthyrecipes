Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
