Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
