recipeingredient:
- "8 bell peppers or any color for that matter"
- "3 lb ground beef no less then 25lbs"
- "1/2 cup uncooked long grain white rice"
- "1 can Campbells family sized tomato soup"
- "2 tbsp garlic powder"
- "1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce"
- "2 tbsp onion powder"
- "2 tbsp Italian Seasoning"
- "1/2 cup hot sauce"
- "2 tbsp Mrs Dash Extra Spicy Seasoning Blend"
- "1 tbsp salt and pepper"
- "1 (6 oz) can of tomato paste"
- "1 bottle Heinz 57 sauce"
recipeinstructions:
- "Remove and discard the tops of those peppers. All of them. Get spoon and scoop them clean- seeds, membranes- all of it. Rinse and set them aside."
- "Preheat oven to 300."
- "Cook the rice- put it in a saucepan with water and bring it to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and cook for 20 mins. (Until they&#39;re cooked all the way.) Drain."
- "Brown that beef. Put it in a pan, mix, stir and cook until brown. Drain that nasty oil."
- "Don&#39;t wash your hands yet. Take your mixture and start stuffing the heck out of those peppers. Fill those babies tight and full. Let them over flow a little, they can look like cupcakes."
- "Grab your Heinz. Go ahead and squirt some of it over the over flow of meat coming out of those peppers. (Cupcakes need icing!)"
- "Get a bowl. A big one. Your hands are about to get dirty. Add the browned beef, rice, the can of paste, all of the seasonings. Pretty much everything except the tomato soup and Heinz. (Don&#39;t touch that stuff, we aren&#39;t using it yet.) Get your hands in there- mix everything, mix it real good. Go ahead and taste it. You may want to add more salt or one of the seasonings- add more if you want."
- "Get that big pot out. Pour your tomato soup in it; add 1 cup of water for now. Mix it real good. Stir harder, don&#39;t be lazy."
- "Arrange the peppers in your big pot. (Yes, they&#39;re going into the tomato soup.) Now- add more water. The soup/water needs to come up to the very top of the peppers, completely covering those babies. (The peppers. Not the meat that&#39;s over flowing out of them.)"
- "Put a cover on your big pot (I just use foil) and put those babies in the oven. They need to cook for a while, a long while- so I hope you&#39;re not hungry- because your house is about to smell AMAZE-BALLZ."
- "Keep checking the peppers as they cook, sometimes they&#39;ll float and flip over."
- "About three hours or so, they should be ready to be inhaled. (You can check by poking the pepper and seeing how soft they are- the softer, the better.)"

Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!
