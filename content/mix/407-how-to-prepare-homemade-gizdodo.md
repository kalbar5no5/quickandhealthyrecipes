Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!
