Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
