How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
