Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood.

These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.
