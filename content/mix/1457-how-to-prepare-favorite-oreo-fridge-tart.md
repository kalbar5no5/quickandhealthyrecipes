How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
