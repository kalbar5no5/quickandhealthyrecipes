Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
