Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
