Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
