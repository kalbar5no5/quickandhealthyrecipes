Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
