Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
