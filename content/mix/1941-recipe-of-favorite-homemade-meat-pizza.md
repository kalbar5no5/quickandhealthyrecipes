Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
