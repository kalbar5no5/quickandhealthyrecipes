Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
