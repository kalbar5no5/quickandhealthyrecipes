Fresh ginger and red pepper flakes add welcome zing, but the real surprise here is napa (aka Chinese) cabbage. Cara Mangini, of Little Eater in Columbus, Ohio, likes it for slaws because it&#39;s more tender than ordinary cabbage but still holds up better than lettuce. Spinach has tons of vitamin A (over half of the recommended daily amount in a serving!), which helps boost and enhance our immune system â€” so make like Popeye and add this leafy green to your diet.

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
