Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
