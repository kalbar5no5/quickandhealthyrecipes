Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!
