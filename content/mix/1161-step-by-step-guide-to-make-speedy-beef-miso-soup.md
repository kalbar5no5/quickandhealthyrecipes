Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
