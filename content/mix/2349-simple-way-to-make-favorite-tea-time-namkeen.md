Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
