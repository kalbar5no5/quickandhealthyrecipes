Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
