Juicy chicken burgers made with ground chicken and flavored with Ranch seasoning mix and cheddar cheese right in the burger. These chicken burgers are so full of flavor, you can make it into a burger or eat it with a side dish. Topped with crispy bacon, juicy tomatoes, and lettuce, this burger is a twist on one of your favorite sandwiches. I would season my chicken burger like I would a chicken breast. That meant mayonnaise, salt, pepper, and garlic. 

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
