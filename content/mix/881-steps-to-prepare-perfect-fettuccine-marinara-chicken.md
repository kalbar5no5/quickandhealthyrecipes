Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
