Every region of the country has their signature dish and Gumbo is the star of Louisiana. Begin by adding the oil to a large Dutch oven, or large enough pot to hold all these ingredients, factoring in the chicken stock. Once the oil is heated add in the chicken, and season with some salt and pepper. Cajun gumbo is the tomato-free version of this legendary Louisiana stew, though there are otherwise very few rules that govern what goes into the pot.

Once the oil is heated add in the chicken, and season with some salt and pepper. Cajun gumbo is the tomato-free version of this legendary Louisiana stew, though there are otherwise very few rules that govern what goes into the pot. In this recipe, we use the classic combo of chicken and andouille sausage, but feel free to change it up with other proteins. Most chicken gumbos these days are served with chicken that has been removed from the bone. Lawd have mercy, this Authentic New Orleans Cajun Gumbo is unbelievably delicious, thick, rich and full of Cajun flavor! 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
