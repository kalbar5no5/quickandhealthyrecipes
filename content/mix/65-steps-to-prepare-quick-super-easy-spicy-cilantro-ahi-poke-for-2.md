Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
