recipeinstructions:

If using canned refried pinto beans just set aside 1/4 cups, and transfer the remaining good stuff on a container and store it in fridge."
- "Fill large pot with water (about 6-8 cups), set steamer and place washed root crop. Cover with lid. Turn heat to high. Soon as the water boil, turn heat down to medium. Let root crop steam for 30 minutes. NOTE: A. you don&#39;t want a burnt pot ðŸ¤­, so check water level every 10 minutes. Add water when necessary.

Stir fry onion until semi translucent, then mix in minced garlic. Soon as garlic is almost golden brown add in cumin, (anise seed - optional) and bell pepper."

Then add in cooked pinto beans and sauce mix. Stir then let it simmer with lid cover, over low heat for about 2-4 minutes. If the sauce is reduced, just add 1 or 2 tbsp water and let it simmer for additional 30 sec. more or less, uncovered. Your chilli con carne is done."
- "Your sweet potato is done after 30mins of steaming. But if you want it extra soft, steam it for another 10-15 minutes."
- "Take out the root crop off the steamer. Using a wet, but wringed out hand towel, peel off sweet potato skin to discard it."
- "On chopping board, cut one sweet potato in half lenght wise, then transfer on one serving bowl. Blanket sweet potato with the chilli con carne, and top it with freshly shredded mozarella cheese (optional). Repeat this step for the other sweet potato, and serve that other set to your love one or a friend. Enjoy!"

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
