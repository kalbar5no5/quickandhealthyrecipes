Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
