Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
