Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
