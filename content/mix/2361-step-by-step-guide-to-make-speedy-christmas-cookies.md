Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
