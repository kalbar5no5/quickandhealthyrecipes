Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
