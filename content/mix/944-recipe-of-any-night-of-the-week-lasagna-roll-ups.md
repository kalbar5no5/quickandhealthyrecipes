Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
