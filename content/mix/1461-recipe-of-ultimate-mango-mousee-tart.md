Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
