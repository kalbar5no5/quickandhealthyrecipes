Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
