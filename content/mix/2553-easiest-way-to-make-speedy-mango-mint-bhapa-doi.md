Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
