How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
