Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
