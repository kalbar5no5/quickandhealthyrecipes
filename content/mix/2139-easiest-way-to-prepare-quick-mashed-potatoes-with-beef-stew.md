Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
