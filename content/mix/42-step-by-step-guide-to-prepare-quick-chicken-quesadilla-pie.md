Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
