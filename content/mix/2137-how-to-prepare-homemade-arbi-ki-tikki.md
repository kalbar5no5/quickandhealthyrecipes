Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
