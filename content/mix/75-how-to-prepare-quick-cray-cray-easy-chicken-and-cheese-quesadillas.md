Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
