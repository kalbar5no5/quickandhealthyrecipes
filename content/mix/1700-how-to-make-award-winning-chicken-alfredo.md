Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
