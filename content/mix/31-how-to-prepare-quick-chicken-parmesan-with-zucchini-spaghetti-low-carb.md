Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
