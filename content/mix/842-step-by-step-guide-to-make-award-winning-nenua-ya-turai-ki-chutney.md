Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
