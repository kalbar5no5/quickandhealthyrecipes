Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
