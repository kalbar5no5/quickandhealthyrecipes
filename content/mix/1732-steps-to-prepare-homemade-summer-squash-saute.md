Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
