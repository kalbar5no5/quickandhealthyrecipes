My recipe uses a fish stock and veggies but you could use a different stock base or even just water as a base. The coconut curry soup itself isn&#39;t spicy, so feel free to add some Sriracha on top (make sure it&#39;s vegan because some have fish sauce) or what we did which was to add lots of my scotch bonnet pepper sauce into it. The way the carrot flavour of that hot sauce blends into this soup is truly fantastic. Easy Korean-inspired gochujang sauce that&#39;s vegan, gluten-free, naturally sweetened, and soy-free!

The way the carrot flavour of that hot sauce blends into this soup is truly fantastic. Easy Korean-inspired gochujang sauce that&#39;s vegan, gluten-free, naturally sweetened, and soy-free! You can add a little bit of water to prevent gochujang and doenjang from burning. To make it vegan, simply omit the seafood/meat option. The addition of tofu and mushrooms will be great for a vegan stew. 

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
