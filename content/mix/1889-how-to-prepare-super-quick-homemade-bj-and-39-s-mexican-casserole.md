Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
