Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
