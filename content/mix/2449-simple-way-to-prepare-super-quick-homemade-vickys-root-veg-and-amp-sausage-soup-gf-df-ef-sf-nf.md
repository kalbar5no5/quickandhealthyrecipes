Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
