Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
