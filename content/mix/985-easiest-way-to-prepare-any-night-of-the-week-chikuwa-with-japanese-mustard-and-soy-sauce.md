Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
