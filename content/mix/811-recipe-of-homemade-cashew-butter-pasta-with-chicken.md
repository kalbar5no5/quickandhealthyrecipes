Wow you guys LOVED the Swedish Meatballs I shared last month.

Every time I make homemade cashew butter, I end up talking to the cashews, not trusting they are going to make it into butter. It does take a bit of time cashews - I started with raw organic cashews and lightly toasted them myself. I found a pretty good deal on Amazon. Cooked with butter, cashew nut butter, tangy passata and plenty of spices, this chicken curry is rich, indulgent and ready in less than an hour. Add the chicken and continue to fry until turning golden brown. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
