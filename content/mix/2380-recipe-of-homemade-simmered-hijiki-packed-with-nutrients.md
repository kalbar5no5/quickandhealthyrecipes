Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
