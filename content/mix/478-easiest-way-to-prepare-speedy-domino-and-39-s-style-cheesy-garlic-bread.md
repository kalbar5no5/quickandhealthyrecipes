Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
