Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
