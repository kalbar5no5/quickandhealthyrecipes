Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
