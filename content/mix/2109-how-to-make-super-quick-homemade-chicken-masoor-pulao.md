Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
