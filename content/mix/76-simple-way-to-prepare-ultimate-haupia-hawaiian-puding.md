Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
