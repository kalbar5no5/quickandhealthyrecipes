Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
