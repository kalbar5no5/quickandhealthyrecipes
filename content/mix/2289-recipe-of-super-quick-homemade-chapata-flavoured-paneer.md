Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
