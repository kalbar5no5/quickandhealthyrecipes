Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
