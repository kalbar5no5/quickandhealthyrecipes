Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
