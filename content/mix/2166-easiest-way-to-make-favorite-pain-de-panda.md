recipeinstructions:
- "Put all the ＊ ingredients in a bread machine! (Mix the milk and egg yolk together, and microwave until it&#39;s warmed up to body temperature; 40-60 seconds / 35-38°C.) Put the dry yeast in the yeast compartment."
- "When the dough is done kneading (before the 1st rising starts), take it out of the machine. (Using my bread machine, it takes about 20 minutes.)"
- "Divide the dough into 3 portions for each part of the panda. About 75 g or 1/6 for the cocoa dough; about 210 g or 1/3 for the plain dough; about 285 g or 1/2 for the matcha dough. These weights are what I had (FYI)."
- "Knead the dissolved cocoa powder into the chocolate dough portion, and the dissolved matcha into the matcha dough portion."

- "Deflate the dough lightly, cover again and leave to rest for about 20 to 30 minutes. Deflate again."
- "It&#39;s time to put the loaf together! Roll a bit less than half the plain dough (90 g) and 1/6 each of the cocoa dough (27 g each) into cylindrical shapes by rolling them on your work surface. Stick the cocoa dough pieces on the plain dough piece (the cocoa pieces are the eyes)."
- "Fill the space between the cocoa pieces with about 1/4 of the plain dough."
- "Roll out the remaining plain dough with a rolling pin, and wrap it around the formed dough parts as if you were wrapping a sushi roll. *Put the seam on the bottom and seal."
- "Cut the remaining cocoa dough in half, roll each piece out into a long thin pieces, and attach to the top (for the ears)."
- "Fill the gap between the ears with a bit more than 1/4 of the matcha dough."
- "Roll out the rest of the matcha dough with a rolling pin, and wrap it around the formed dough as if you were wrapping a sushi roll. *Lay seam side down and seal the edges."
- "Put the dough in an oiled square loaf pan (in the middle of the pan) and cover with plastic wrap and a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel. Leave for the 2nd rising, until the dough has risen to 1 cm under the rim of the pan. If proofing it in a microwave, it takes about 50 to 60 minutes."
- "Put the lid on the loaf pan, and bake in a 200 °C oven for 25 to 30 minutes."
- "This is a failed attempt. I added more of the eye-colored dough, and they got too droopy."

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
