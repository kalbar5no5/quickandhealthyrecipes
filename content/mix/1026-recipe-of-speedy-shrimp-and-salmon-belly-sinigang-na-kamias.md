Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
