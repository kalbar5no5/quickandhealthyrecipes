Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
