Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
