Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
