Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
