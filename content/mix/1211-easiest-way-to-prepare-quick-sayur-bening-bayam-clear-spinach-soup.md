Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
