Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
