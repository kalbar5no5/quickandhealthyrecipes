Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
