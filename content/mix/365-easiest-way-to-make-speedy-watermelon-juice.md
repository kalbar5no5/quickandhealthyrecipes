Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
