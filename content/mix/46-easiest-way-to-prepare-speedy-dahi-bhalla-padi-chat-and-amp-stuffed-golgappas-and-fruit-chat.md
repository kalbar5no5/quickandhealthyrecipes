Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
