Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
