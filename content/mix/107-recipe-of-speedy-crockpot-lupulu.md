How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
