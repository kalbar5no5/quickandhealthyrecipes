Italian Sausage and Bean Soup The unusual blend of sausage and beans with coleslaw makes this soup for a cold winter night the definition of complete comfort food. The recipe doubles easily, so serve a crowd and pair with crusty bread and a tossed salad. —Stacey Bennett, Locust Grove, Virginia We made the entire recipe without sausage, and then divided it. For the adults who liked sausage, we added the hot sausage, and for the kids and teens, we mixed in sliced hog dogs (an entire package), reserving some of the hot dog slices for the top of the beans, so they got crispy and dark. No beans were left from the kids and teens version. Brown sausage, then meat, in garlic. 

Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
