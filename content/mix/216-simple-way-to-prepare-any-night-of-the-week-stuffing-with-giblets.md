recipeinstructions:
- "Put livers, gizzards, heart and neck in a pot. Put both containers of chicken stock in the pot and start to boil."
- "Chop onion and celery put in a large pan with butter (use the amount of butter the stuffing boxes call for) and load up with poultry seasoning. Saute until celery and onion are cooked but not mushy. Keep in mind the poultry seasoning needs to be enough to flavor 4 boxes of stuffing. Go heavy on it!"
- "While boiling and cooking the giblets, onion and celery. Empty your boxes of stuffing into a large container. I use a huge pot that I normally have to steam crabs in."
- "Once giblets are cooked soup them out (do not drain off juice keep it and set aside) you will chop up the giblets to desired consistency and toss them into the pan with the celery to stay warm."
- "Once giblets are added you pour the entire pan into pot with the dry stuffing."
- "(Get another set of hands) Have someone hold the pot as you are going to slowly add a cup or two at a time the still boiling hit broth from the giblets into the stuffing mixture. Mix after each pour, to make sure the stuffing doesn&#39;t get overly water logged and moisture is evenly spread through. Usually 4-6 cups about does it. But again don&#39;t add it all at once. You want the stuffing to be moist but have a bit of crunch still. It will soften as it sits and absorbs the liquid more."
- "See my steam in a bag turkey to see what to do with the extra broth that&#39;s left over!"

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
