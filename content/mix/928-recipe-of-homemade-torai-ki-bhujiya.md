A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood.

The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.
