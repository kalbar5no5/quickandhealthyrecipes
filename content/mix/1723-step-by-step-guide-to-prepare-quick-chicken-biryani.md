Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
