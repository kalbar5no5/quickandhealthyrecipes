Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
