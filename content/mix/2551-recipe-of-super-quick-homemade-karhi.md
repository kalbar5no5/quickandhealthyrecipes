Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
