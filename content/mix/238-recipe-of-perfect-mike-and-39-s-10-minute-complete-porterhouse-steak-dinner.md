How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
