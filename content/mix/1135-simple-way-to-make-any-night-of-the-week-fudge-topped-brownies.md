Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
