Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
