Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
