How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
