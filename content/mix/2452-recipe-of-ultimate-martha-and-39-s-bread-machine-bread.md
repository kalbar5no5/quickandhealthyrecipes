Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
