Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
