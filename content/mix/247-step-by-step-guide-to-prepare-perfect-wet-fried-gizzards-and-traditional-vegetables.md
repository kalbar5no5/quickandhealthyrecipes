Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
