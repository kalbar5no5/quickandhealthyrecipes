Hey everyone, it's Jim, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, iz&#39;s seriously good chili. One of my favorites. For mine, I'm gonna make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

I cheat a bit with the seasoning. I have a local butcher that puts out some serious seasoned ground pork. It will still be great chili. But that corny flavor lends itself so well to beefy chili (why do you think we all love cornbread with our chili?) that I highly recommend adding it.

Iz&#39;s Seriously Good Chili is one of the most well liked of current trending foods in the world. It's appreciated by millions daily. It's easy, it is fast, it tastes delicious. Iz&#39;s Seriously Good Chili is something that I've loved my whole life. They're fine and they look fantastic.


To get started with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook iz&#39;s seriously good chili using 11 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Iz&#39;s Seriously Good Chili:

1. Prepare 1 medium onion, chopped
1. Prepare 1 lb ground chuck
1. Prepare 1 lb ground pork

For our first time making chili we think its pretty damn good !! I have bad memories of my chili-eating college daysâ€”when chili was made by adding a can of beans and a can of tomatoes to ground beef, then adding one of every spice on the rack (and two of cumin), then simmering. The finished product inevitably had a totally unbalanced flavor, with a powdery, gritty mouthfeel from the dried spices. You can always add more veggies to this or even some spicy sausage or bacon, chili is great because you can truly make it your own.

##### Instructions to make Iz&#39;s Seriously Good Chili:

1. Place onion, pork, and beef into large heavy pot. I use my dutch oven. Brown on low heat. I don&#39;t drain, I am not looking for some low fat pansy stuff - I want chili!
1. Dice up the roma tomatoes and add them in. Cook tomatoes down a bit.
1. Put in beans and chilies. No...I don&#39;t rinse. Refer to step one for reason.
1. Add tomato sauce and water. If you like thick chili add less. Thinner? You can figure it out...
1. Finally the chili powder. First unscrew the lid, pull off that plastic piece with the holes and throw that in the trashcan. Next put some chili powder in. Don&#39;t be afraid of it, it&#39;s your friend. See picture for approximate amount.
1. Pop a beer and settle down. This needs to simmer for a while. 60 minutes minimum. Add water or beer to maintain desired thickness. Throw a lid on it if you prefer. Oh and this gives you plenty of time to get those grilled cheeses made.


The finished product inevitably had a totally unbalanced flavor, with a powdery, gritty mouthfeel from the dried spices. You can always add more veggies to this or even some spicy sausage or bacon, chili is great because you can truly make it your own. Serve with some shredded cheese, a dollop of sour cream or even slices of avocado and enjoy! The ultimate chili should have a rich, complex flavor that combines sweet, bitter, hot, fresh, and fruity elements in balance, along with tender, creamy beans and chunks of beef bound together in a deep-red sauce. This bean-rich, ground beef chili will not only be delicious today, but it might even taste better tomorrow. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
