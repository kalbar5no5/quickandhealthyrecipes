Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
