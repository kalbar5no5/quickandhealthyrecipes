How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
