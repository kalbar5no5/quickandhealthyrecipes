Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
