Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
