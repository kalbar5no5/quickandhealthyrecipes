Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
