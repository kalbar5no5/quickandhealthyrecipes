Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
