Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
