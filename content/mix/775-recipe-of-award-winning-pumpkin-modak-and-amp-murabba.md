Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
