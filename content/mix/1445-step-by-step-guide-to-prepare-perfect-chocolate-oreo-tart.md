How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
