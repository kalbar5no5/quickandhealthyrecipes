Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
