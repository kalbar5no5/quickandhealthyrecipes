Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!
