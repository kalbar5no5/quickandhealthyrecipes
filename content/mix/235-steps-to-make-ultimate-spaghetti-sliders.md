Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
