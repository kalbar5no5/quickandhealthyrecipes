Its leaves float on the surface of the water and have a special characteristic whereby they never get wet: water literally just rolls off the leaves.

The dish of bhaen (lotus root) is probably unique to the Punjab; in some places it is also known as kamal di dandi.

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
