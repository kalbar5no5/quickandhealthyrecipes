Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
