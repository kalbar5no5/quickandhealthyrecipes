Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
