Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
