Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
