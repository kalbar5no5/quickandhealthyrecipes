Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
