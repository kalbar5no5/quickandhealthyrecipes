Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
