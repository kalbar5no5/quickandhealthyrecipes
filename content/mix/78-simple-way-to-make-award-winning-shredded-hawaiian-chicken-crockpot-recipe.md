Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
