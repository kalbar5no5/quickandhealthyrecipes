Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
