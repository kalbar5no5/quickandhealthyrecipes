Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
