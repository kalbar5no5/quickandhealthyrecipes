Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
