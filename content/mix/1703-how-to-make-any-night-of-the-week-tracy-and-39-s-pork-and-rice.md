Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
