Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
