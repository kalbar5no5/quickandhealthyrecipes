Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
