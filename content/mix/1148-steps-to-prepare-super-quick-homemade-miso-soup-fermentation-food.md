Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
