Kunun-aya is a traditional fermented non-alcoholic tiger-nut beverage widely consumed in the Northern parts of Nigeria especially during dry season. Kunun-aya was prepared from tiger-nut, coconut, date and spices such as cinnamon, cloves, coriander, ginger. I was told on the forum that someone had received the recipe via the commissions quest so it is my hint so far but i am unable to verify it myself as i have not received any food commission quests yet. 

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
