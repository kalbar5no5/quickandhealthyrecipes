How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
