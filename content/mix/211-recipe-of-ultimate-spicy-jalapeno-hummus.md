Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
