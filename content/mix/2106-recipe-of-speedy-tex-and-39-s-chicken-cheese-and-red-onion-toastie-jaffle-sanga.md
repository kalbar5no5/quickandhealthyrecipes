Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
