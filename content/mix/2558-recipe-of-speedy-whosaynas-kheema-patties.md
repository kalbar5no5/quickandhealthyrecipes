Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
