Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
