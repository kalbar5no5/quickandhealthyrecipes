Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
