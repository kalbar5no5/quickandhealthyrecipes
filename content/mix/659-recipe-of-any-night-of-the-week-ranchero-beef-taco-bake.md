How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
