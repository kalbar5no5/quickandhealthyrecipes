Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood.

Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression.

They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful!
