In a separate bowl, combine all the crumble ingredients (I combined by hand). This is a cinnamon-scented twist on apple pie which is fun to make and always wows. The same homemade or store bought pie dough forms both the base crust and the topping—the fun part happens when a sweetened cinnamon-butter is spread on half of the dough and rolled up like a log and chilled then sliced and fanned over the apples and baked until golden brown and bubbly. Place apples in large bowl, sprinkle with lime juice, then remaining flour; stir to mix, then fold in mango chunks.

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
