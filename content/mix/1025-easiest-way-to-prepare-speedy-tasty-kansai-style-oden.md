The oden at Konakara is more refined, prepared in the Kansai style. As an otoshi starter to go with your first beer or sake, you will be served a couple of mouthfuls of vegetables — perhaps some. In the Kansai area, oden is called &#34;Kanto-ni (Kanto-daki) Kanto-ni is sweet and mildly flavored in the Kansai area compared to Kanto&#39;s oden, which is flavored with soup stock and soy sauce. It is said that this cooking style was brought from Kanto and has become established with the Kansai taste. Oden is great to partner with alcohol so it&#39;s quite usual for izakaya bars to have it on the menu. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
