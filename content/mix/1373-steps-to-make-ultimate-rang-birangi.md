Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
