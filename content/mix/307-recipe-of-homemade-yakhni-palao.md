Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
