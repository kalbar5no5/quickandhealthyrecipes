Mom&#39;s green enchiladas are always a big hit! They&#39;re loaded with seasoned shredded chicken, sour cream, LOTS of cheese, and topped with a green chile sauce. Consider pairing these with Refried Beans, Roasted Salsa Verde, or Favorite Beef Tacos. 

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
