- "Steal about a 1/4 cup of the hot cooking oil which your chicken had just cooked in and place in a heat proof bowl. Add remaining 1 Tsp of Cayenne Powder, 1/2 Tsp of Chilli Powder, and 1/2 Tsp of Paprika along with the brown sugar and the apple cider vinegar. Stir until well combined."
- "Once the chicken has drained, place on a plate and spoon the hot oil mixture all over the breasts until they are well coated. Place onto sandwich rolls and top with the homemade coleslaw."

Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
