In my opinion, the best chili recipe is a base of ground beef, tomato, spices, and BEANS. I love the number of fiber beans add to this dish and I promise you won&#39;t regret adding them. 

Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
