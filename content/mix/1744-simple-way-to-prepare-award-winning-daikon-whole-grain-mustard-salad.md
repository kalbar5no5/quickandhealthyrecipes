Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
