How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
