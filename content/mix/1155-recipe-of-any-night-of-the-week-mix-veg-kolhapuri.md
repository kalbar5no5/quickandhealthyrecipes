Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
