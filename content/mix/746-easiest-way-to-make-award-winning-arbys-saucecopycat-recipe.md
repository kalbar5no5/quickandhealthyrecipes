Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
