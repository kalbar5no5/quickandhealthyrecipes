How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
