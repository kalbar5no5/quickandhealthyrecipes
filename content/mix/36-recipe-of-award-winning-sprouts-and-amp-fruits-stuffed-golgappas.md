Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!
