Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
