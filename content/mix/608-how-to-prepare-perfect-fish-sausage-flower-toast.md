Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
