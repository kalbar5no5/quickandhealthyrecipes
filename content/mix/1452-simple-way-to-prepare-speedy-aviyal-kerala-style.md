How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
