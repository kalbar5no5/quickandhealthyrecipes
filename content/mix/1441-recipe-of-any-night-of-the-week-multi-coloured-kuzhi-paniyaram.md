How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
