Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body.
