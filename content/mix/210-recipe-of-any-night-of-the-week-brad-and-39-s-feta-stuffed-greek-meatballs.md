How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
