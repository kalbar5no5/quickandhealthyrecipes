Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
