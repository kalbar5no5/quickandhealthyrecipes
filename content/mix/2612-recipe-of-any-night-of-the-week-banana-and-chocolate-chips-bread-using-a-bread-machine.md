How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
