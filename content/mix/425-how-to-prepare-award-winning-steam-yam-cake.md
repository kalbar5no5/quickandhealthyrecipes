How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
