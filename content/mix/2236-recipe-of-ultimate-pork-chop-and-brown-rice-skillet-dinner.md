Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
