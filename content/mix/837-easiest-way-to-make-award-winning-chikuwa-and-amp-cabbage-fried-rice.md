Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
