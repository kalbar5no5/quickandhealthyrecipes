It&#39;s simple, but with lots of flavor. I make it all the time when it&#39;s too hot to cook. I just bake the chicken or boil it in broth, then dice it up. I&#39;ve made it with a variety of different nuts - pecans, walnuts - and low-fat mayonnaise.

I just bake the chicken or boil it in broth, then dice it up. I&#39;ve made it with a variety of different nuts - pecans, walnuts - and low-fat mayonnaise. Chop cooked and cooled chicken and place into a large bowl with celery and onions. Mix dressing ingredients (per recipe below) in a bowl. It uses just three simple ingredients, but it&#39;s a big hit on sandwiches or atop a bed of lettuce. 

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
