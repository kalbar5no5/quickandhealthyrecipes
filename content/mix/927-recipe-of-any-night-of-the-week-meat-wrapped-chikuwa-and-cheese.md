Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
