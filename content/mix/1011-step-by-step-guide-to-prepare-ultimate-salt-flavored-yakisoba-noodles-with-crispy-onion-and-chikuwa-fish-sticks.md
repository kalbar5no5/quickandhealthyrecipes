Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
