Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
