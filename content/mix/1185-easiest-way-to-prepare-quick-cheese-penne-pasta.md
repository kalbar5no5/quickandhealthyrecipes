If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times.

These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process.
