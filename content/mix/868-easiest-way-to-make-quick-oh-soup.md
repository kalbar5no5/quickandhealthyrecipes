Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
