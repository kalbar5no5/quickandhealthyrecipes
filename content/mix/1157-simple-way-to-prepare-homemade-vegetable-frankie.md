Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
