How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
