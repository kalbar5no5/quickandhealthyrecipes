Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
