Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
