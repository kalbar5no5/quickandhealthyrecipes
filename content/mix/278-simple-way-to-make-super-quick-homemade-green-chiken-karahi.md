As a general rule, Karahis are made from a base of ginger, garlic and tomatoes and also contain fresh green chillis, julienne-cut raw ginger and coriander. It&#39;s a rather thick, jammy gravy and concentrated in flavour - yum! The traditional Karahi has undergone pretty major alterations over time. 

How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
