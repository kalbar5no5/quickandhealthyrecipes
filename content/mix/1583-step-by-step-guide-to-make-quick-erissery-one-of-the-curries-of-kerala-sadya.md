Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
