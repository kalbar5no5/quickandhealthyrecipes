Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
