Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
