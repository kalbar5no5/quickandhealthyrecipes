Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
