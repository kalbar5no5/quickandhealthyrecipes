Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
