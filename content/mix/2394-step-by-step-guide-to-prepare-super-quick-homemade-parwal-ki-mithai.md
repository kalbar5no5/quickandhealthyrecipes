Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
