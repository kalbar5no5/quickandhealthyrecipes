Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
