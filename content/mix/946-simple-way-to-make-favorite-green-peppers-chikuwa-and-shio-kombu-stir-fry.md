Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
