Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
