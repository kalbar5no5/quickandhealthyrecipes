Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
