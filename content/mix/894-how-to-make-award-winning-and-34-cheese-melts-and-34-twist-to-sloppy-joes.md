Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
