Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
