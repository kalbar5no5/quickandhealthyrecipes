Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
