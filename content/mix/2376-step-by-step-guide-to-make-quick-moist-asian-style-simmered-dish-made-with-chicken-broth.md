Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
