Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
