Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
