Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
