Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
