Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
