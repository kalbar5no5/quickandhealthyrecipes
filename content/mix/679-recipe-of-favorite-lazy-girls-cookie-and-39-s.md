Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
