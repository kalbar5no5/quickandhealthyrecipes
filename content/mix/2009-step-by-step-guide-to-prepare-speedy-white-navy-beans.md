They got this name from becoming a staple food for the US Navy. Our dried white beans are pea-sized, which has given them another name, &#34;white pea beans&#34;, and have a mild creamy flavor. They are very similar to cannellini beans, which can also be white. Navy beans, also called pea beans, are small, oval-shaped white beans.

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
