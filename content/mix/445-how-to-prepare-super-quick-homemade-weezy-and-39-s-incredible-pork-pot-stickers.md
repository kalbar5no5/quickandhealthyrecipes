recipeinstructions:
- "To make pot sticker wrappers - Combine flour and water in a mixing bowl. Knead on a lightly floured surface until dough no longer sticks to your hands. If more water is needed, add only by the teaspoon. Make a log shape with the dough of about 1½ inches in diameter. Cut dough at roughly 1inch intervals...be generous if you like larger pot stickers. Roll into balls and roll each ball flat with rolling pin. If you are stacking the wrappers to fill later, add flour between each wrapper to avoid them sticking. Otherwise, fill with pork mixture straight away and fold over in half, crimping the edges closed with your fingertips."
- "Begin to stir fry pork until slightly browned. Drain any excess fat if necessary then add remaining ingredients. Continue to stir until meat is completely cooked and everything is simmering nicely together."
- "Fill the pot sticker wrappers using a teaspoon and fill to your desire. Grease a large frying pan and place pot stickers creased side up so the bottom flattens. Fry for a few minutes until bottom is golden brown. Pour a cup of water carefully into the pan then cover and let steam on medium heat for 20-25 minutes. Continue to check and add more water to pan if necessary."
- "If you like a kick to your dish, try a side cup of soya sauce with a chopped scotch bonnet pepper for dipping"

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
