Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
