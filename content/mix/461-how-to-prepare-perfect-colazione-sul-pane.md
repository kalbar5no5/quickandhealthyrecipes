Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
