Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
