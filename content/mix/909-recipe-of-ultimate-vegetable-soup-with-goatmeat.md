Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
