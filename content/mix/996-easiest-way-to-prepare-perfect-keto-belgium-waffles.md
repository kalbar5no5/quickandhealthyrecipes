Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
