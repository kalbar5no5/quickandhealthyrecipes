How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
