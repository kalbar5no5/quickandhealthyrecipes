Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
