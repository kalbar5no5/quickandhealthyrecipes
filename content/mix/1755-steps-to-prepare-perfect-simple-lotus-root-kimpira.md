Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
