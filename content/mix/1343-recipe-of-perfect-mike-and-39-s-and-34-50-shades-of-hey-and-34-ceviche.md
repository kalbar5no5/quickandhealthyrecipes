recipeinstructions:
- "Chop all chilled veggies except for the Avacados and place in an extra large bowl. Avocado spoils and browns much too quickly to ever incorporate it directly [unless you&#39;re serving it immediately] regardless if you&#39;ve seasoned with lime juice. The acidity in this dish may negatively react to some metals giving your Ceviche a tin or metallic taste so be sure to use a plastic bowl or another non-metal option."
- "De-thaw all seafood in cold water. Once thawed, cut Scallops in half or thirds [if using the large ones] and shread the Imitation Crab Meat in larger chunks as they will fall apart during mixing. I use imitation crab meat since it lasts much longer than real crab without spoiling and doesn&#39;t overpower the dish. Leave the Shrimp in tact but de-husk, de-vein and de-tail them if necessary. Place all seafood in your vegetable bowl."
- "Pour in chilled Clamato Juice 2&#34; to 3&#34; inches from the top of your ingredients, 2/3 bottle of chilled Tabasco, 1/2 of your chilled Spicy V8, Worcestershire Sauce and your chilled fruit juices."
- "Add all spices and fold in gently."
- "Taste test juice for spiciness and add more of your bottle of Tabasco and a little more of your Spicy V8 if it suits your pallet. I adore a spicy Ceviche so I usually end up using the entire 12 ozs of the bottle of Tabasco in this dish."
- "This Ceviche is best after sitting for 24 hours or 10 hours at the very least. As it sits and chills, gently stir it every few hours to ensure the seafood absorbs the colors, juices and spices."
- "Serve in a large chilled chalice or glass rimmed with juice, lime juice and Tabasco Seasoned Salt or regular salt/sea salt, fresh quality crackers or toasted Baguettes of your choosing, an ice cold Mexican beer, [such as Corona] lime wedges, Avacado slices and a side bottle of Tabasco for your more adventurous guests!"
- "You can also serve this dish in lettuce wraps or even edible parmesan bowls. Get creative! Enjoy!  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/357097-mikes-ez-edible-parmesan-bowls"

Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
