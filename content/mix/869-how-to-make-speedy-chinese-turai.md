Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
