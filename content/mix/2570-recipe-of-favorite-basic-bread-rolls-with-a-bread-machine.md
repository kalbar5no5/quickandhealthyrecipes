Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at fighting depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
