Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
