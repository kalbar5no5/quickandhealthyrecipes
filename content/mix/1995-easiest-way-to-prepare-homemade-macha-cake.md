Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
