Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
