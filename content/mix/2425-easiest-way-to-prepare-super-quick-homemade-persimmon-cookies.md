Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
