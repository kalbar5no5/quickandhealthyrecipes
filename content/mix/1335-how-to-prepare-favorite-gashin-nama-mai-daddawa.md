Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
