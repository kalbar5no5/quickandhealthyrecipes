Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
