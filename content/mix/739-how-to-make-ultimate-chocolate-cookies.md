How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
