Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
