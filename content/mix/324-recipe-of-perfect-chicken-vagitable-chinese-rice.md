Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
