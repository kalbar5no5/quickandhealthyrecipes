Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
