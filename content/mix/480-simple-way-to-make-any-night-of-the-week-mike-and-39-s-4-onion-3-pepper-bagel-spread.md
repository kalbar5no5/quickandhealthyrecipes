Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
