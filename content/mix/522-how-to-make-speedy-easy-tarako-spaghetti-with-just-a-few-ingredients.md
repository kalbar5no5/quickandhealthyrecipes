Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.
