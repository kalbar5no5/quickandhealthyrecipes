Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
