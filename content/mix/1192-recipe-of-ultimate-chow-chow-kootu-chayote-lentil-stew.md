Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
