How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
