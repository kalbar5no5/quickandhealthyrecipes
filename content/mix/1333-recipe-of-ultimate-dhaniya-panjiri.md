Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
