Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
