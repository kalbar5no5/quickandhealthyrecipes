Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
