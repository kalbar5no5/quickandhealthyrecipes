Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
