Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
