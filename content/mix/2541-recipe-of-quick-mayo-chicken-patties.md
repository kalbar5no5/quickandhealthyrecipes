Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
