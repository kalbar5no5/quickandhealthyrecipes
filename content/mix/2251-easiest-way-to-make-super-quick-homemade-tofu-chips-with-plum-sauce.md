Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
