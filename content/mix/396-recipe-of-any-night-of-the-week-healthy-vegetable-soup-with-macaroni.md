Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
