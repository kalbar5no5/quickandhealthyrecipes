Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
