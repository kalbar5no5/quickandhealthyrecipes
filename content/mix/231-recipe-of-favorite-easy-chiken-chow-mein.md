Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
