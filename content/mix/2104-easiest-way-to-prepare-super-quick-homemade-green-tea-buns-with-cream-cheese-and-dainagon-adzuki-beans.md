Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
