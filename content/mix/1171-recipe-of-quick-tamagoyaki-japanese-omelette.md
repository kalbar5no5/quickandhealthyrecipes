Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
