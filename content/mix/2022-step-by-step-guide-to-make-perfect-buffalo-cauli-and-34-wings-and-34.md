Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk.

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood.

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished!
