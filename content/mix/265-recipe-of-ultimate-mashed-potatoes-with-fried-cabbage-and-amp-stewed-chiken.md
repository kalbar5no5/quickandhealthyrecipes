How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
