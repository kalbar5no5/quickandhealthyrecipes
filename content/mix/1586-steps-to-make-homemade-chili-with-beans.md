Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
