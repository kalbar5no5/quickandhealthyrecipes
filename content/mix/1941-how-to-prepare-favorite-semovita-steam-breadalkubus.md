Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
