Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
