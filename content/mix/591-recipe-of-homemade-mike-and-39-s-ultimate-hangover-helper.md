Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
