Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
