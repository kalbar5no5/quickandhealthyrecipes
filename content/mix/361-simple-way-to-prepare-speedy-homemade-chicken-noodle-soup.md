Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
