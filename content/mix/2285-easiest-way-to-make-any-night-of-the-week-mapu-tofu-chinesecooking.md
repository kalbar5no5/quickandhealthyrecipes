Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
