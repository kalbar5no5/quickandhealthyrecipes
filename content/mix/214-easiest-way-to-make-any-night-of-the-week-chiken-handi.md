Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
