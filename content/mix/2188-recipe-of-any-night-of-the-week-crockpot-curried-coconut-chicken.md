Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
