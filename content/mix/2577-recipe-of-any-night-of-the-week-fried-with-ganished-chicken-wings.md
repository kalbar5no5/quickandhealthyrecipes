Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
