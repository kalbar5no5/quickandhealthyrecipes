Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
