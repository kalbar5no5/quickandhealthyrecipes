Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
