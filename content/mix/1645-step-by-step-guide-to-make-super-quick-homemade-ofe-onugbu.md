Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
