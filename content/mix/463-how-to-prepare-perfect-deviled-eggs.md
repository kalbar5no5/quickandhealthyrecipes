Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
