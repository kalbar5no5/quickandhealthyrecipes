Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
