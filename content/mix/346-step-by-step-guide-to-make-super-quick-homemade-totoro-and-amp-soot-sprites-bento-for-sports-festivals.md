Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
