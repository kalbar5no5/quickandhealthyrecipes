How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
