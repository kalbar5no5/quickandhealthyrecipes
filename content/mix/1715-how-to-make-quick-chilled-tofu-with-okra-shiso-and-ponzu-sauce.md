Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
