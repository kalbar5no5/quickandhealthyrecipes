Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
