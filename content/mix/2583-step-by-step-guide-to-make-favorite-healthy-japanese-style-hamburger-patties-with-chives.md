Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
