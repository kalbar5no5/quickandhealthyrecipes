Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
