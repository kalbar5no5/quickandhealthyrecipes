Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
