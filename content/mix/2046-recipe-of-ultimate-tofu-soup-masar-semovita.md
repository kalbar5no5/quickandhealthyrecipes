Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
