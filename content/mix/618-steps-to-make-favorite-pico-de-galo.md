Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
