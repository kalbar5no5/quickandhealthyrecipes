Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
