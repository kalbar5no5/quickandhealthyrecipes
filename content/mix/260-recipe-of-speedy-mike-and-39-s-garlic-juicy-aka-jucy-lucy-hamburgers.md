Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.
