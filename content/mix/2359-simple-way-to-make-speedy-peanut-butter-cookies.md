Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
