Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
