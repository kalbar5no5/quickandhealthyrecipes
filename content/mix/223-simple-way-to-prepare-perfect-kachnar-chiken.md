Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
