Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
