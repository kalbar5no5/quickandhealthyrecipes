Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
