How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
