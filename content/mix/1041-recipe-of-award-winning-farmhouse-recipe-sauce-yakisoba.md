Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
