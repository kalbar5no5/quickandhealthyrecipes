That&#39;s where protein comes into play. The macronutrient helps rebuild damaged cells and make You&#39;re not imagining it. This totally vegetarian sandwich contains protein-packed veggies, goat. I don&#39;t believe that peanut butter or bread alone are complete protein sources (give you all essential amino acids), but they may complement each other to ensure the delivery of all amino acids. This sandwich has more sugar than five Oreos! 

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
