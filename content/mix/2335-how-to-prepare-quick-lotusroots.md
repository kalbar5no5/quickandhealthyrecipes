Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
