Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!
