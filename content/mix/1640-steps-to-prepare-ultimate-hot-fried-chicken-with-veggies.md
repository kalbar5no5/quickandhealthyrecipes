Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
