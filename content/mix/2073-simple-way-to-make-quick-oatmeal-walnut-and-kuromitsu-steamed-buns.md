Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
