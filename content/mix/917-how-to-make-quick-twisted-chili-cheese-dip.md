Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
