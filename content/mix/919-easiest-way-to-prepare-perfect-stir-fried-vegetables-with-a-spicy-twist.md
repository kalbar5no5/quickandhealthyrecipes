Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
