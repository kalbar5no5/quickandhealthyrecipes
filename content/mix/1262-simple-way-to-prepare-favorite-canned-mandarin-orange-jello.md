Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
