I eat tuwon shinkafa with any soup of my choice but, as a child i loved Miyan gbusheshen kubewa (dried okro soup) specially made by my mom&#39;s friend and like you, i don&#39;t like miyan kuka! Thanks for remembering us from the North and therefore, on behalf of all Arewa people i say SAANU DA AIKI! This is a popular soup here in the north and common among the hausa people,it is prepared using boabab leaves powder and can be enjoyed with tuwo,semovita,cous cous etc. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
