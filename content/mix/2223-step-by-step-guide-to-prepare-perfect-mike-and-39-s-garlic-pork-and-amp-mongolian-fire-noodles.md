Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
