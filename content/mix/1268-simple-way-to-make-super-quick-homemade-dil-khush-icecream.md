Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
