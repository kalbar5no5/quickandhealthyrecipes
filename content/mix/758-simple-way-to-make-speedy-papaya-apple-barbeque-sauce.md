Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
