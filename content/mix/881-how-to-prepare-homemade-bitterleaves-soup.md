Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
