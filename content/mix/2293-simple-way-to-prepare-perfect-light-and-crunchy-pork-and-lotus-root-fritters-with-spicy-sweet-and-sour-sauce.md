Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
