Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
