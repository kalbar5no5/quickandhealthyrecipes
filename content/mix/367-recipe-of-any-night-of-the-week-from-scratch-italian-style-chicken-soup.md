recipeingredient:
- "3 lb roasted chicken"
- "2 tbsp salt for boiling the roasted chicken"
- "3 tbsp olive oil extra virgin"
- "2 small onions chopped"
- "1 tsp salt for reducing the veggies"
- "2 large celery sticks coarsely chopped"
- "3 large carrots coined"
- "1 1/2 tbsp granulated garlic"
- "1 tbsp onion powder"
- "1/2 tsp Italian red pepper flakes"
- "3/4 tsp rosemary ground"
- "1 tbsp bay leaf ground"
- "1 tbsp ground black pepper"
- "6 large potatoes diced optional"
- "1 lb large cannelini beans precooked"
- "1 handful basil chopped"
- "1 cup orzo macaroni"
- "1 lb escarole or rabe chopped coarsely"
recipeinstructions:
- "First, roast the chicken if you have not yet, and remember to remove the giblets first.  Giblets can either make a rich gravy in a pan or a nasty surprise in the center of a cooked chicken.  Don&#39;t let the latter happen to you.  350F, about 2hrs or so, and 165°F minimum internal temperature is required.  Roasting first will reduce the amount of grease in your soup."
- "If you just cooked it, when the chicken is cool, break it down.  If you are using chicken from last night&#39;s dinner, break that  carcass down.  Separate bones and skin from meat, into two piles."
- "Set aside the meat, and throw the carcass, skin, etc., into an 8 qt pot of water with 2 tablespoons salt.  Bring the pot to boiling, and boil for about 10 or 15 minutes."
- "In the meanwhile, in another 8 qt pot, pour in the oil, and the onions, and the salt, and simmer on low for about 2 minutes."
- "Add the celery and carrots to the onions and simmer for another 3 minutes."
- "Add the seasonings, and let that all marry for another 5 minutes or so, stirring occasionally."
- "Now, add the cooked cannelini, and, if you choose, add the potatoes."
- "Your boiled carcass should be pretty well broken down by the hot water and salt now.  Separate the broth from the carcass.  Set aside the carcass for the next step, and dump the plain chicken broth into the veggie pot."
- "Break down the carcass one last time, tossing whatever meat you can now get into the pot.  Toss the bones to the dogs/trash/Tasmanian devil/whatever."
- "Crank up the heat to about medium high, and boil the soup until the potatoes are tender."
- "Add in your basil, orzo, and greens.  So, if you are Italian, you might be used to bitter olives, dandelion, etc.  In such a case, you can add the pound of rabe now.  It&#39;s bitter, and it will add a slightly bitter dimension to the broth.  If you aren&#39;t into that, then use escarole, which is not nearly so bitter."
- "Cook the orzo until tender, and then remove from heat, salt and pepper to taste, and serve.  Note, this recipe is pretty low sodium as is, and if you are looking for that canned soup or premade broth flavor, you&#39;ll probably need to add a tablespoon or three more of salt to the broth.  It really makes you think about your salt intake, doesn&#39;t it?  Enjoy!"
- "(What, no tomato?  Nope.  I do my chicken and tomato soup differently, but that is for a different day.)"

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
