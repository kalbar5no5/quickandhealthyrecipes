Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
