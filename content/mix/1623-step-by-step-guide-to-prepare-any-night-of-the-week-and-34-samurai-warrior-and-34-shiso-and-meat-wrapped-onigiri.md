How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
