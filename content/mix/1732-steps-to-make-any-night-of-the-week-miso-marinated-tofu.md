Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
