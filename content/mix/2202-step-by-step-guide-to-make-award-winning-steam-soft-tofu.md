Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
