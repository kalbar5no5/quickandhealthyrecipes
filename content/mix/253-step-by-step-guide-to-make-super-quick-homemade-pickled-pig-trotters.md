Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
