Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
