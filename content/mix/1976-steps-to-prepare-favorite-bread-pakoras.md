How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
