Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
