Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
