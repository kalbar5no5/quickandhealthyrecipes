How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
