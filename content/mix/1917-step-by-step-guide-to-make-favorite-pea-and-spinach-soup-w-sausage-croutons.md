This is a delicious recipe and full of great flavours. Cook sausage in a large saucepan coated with cooking spray over high heat until browned, stirring to crumble. Cover and bring to a boil. A split-pea puree is extra nutritious (and extra green) thanks to baby spinach. The swirl of plain yogurt brings brightness, and a sprinkle of barley gives the make-ahead soup another healthy boostâ€”it contains the soluble fiber beta-glucan, which has been found to do wonders to lower bad cholesterol. 

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
