How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
