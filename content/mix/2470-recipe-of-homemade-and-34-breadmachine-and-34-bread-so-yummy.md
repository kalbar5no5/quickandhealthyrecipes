Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
