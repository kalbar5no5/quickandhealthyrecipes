Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
