Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!
