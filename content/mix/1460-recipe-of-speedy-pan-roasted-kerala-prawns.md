Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
