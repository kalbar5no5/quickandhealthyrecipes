Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
