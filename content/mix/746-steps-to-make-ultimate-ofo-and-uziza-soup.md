Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
