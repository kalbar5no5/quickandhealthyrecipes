Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
