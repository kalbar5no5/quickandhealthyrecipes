Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
