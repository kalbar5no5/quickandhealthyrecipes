How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
