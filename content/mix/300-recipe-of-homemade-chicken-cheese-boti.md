Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
