Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
