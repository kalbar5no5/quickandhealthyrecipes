Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
