Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
