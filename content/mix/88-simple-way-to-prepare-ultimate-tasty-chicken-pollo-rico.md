Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
