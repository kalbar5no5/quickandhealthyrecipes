Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
