Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
