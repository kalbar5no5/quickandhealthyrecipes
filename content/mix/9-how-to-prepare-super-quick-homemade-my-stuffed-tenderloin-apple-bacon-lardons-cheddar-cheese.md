Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
