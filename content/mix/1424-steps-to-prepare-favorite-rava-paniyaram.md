Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
