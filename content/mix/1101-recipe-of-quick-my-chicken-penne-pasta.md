Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
