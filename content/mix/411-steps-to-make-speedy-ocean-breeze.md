Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
