How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
