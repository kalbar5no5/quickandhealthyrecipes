Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
