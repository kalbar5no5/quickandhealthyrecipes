Whenever I visit a bakery the first type of bread that I look for is any bread with mentaiko. Usually it is a petit baguette that is sliced in half and schmeared with a mixture of mentaiko, butter, and garlic that is simply toasted lightly.. In a blazing hot sauté pan over high heat, add the butter and the minced/puréed kimchi. Add the mentaiko, stirring constantly, to lightly toast. I got the idea for this recipe from the mentaiko and cream cheese filling that another user, &#34;nonmam&#34;, made. 

Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
