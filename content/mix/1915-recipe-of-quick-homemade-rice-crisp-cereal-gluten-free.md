Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
