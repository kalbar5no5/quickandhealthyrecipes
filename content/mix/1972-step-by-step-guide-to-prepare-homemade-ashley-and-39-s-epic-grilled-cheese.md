Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
