Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better.

Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine.
