Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
