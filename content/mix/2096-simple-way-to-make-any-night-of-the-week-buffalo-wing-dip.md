Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
