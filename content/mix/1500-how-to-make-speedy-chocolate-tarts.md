Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
