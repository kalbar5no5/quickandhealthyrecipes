Spanish chorizo has a much greater percentage of paprika than the Portuguese chouriço. The night before I traveled down to New Jersey to unite with my mother, aunt, cousin and niece to make &#34;chouriço&#34; (Portuguese smoked sausage), &#34;O Lenço da Carolina&#34; by Fado singer Cristina Branco came on via Portuguese satellite TV. Though it&#39;s a song about a person in love, all I could think about (as tears unexpectedly streamed down my face) was the immigrant&#39;s journey. Chouriço, on the other hand, has considerably less paprika and much more garlic and black pepper.

Though it&#39;s a song about a person in love, all I could think about (as tears unexpectedly streamed down my face) was the immigrant&#39;s journey. Chouriço, on the other hand, has considerably less paprika and much more garlic and black pepper. In addition, lots of Portuguese red wine is splashed in to round out the flavor. In short, it&#39;s got a bigger bite that can hold its own in lots of dishes. Chouriço is one of my favorite sausages as a Brazilian who also grew up with my vovó cooking for us! krystal says. 

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
