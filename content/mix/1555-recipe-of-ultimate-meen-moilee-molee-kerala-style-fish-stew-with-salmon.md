How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
