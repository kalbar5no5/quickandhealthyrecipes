Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
