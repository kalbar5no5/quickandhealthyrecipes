Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
