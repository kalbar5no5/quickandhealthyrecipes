Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
