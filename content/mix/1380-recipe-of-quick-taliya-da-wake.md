Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
