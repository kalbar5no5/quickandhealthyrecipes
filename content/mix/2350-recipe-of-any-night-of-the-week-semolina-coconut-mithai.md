Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
