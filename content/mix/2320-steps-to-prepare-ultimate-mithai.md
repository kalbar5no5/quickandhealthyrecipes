Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body.
