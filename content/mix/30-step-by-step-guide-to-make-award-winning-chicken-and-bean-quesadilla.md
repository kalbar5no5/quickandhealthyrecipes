Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
