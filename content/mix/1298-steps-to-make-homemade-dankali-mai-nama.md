Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
