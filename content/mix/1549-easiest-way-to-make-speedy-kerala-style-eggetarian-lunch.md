Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
