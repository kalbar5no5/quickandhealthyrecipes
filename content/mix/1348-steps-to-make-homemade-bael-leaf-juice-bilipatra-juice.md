Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!
