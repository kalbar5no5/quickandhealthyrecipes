Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
