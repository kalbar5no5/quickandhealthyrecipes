Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
