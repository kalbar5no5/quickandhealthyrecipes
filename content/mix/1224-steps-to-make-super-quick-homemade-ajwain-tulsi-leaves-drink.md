Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
