recipeinstructions:
- "The sushi rice: Cook the rice, mix with sushi vinegar while it&#39;s still hot and set aside to let cool."
- "Prepare the additional ingredients: Either grill or microwave a piece of salted salmon to cook it through. You can put it in the rice cooker and cook it along with the rice and take it out when both are done if you like."
- "Mix the eggs and milk together, and make finely scrambled eggs (iri tamago) using just a little oil. You can cook it in a nonstick frying pan without any oil instead."
- "Using two different sized molds or bowls or cups etc. for the cake, pack with the scrambled eggs → sushi rice → nori seaweed → sushi rice → cooked flaked salmon → sushi rice, in that order."
- "Invert the two packed molds to form two layers. Place the smaller &#34;cake&#34; on the very edge of the bigger &#34;cake&#34;."
- "Decorate: Slice the daikon radish thinly, sprinkle with salt and massage it in to tenderize it. Cut a slice for the cake message and leave it to soak for a while in sushi vinegar."
- "Cut the smoked salmon into 5 to 6 cm pieces. Layer and roll them up into rose shapes. Spread out the outer &#39;petals&#39; to make them look extra-voluminous."
- "Roll the thinly sliced and salted daikon radish to make rosebuds. If the daikon radish is too thick or not squeezed out tightly enough it will be hard to roll!"
- "Microwave the snow peas, slice in half diagonally and use as &#34;leaves&#34; around the roses."
- "Make the mashed potatoes. Cook potatoes in the microwave and mash them up. Add salt, mayonnaise, milk, and a tiny bit of butter, and pass the mixture through a sieve."
- "After passing the mashed potato mixture through a sieve, add some milk so that it&#39;s the consistency of cream. Put the potato-cream in a piping bag fitted with an icing tip and decorate the cake with it."
- "Make the &#34;lace&#34; for the cake. Slice the lotus root thinly, cook in the microwave and sprinkle with salt. Put the slices around the cake."
- "Cut the quail egg face parts out of nori seaweed using scissors or a nori punch (used for bentos). Cut letters out for the daikon radish plaque. If you moisten the surface of the eggs and daikon radish slightly it&#39;s easier to stick on the nori."
- "*Add color to the quail egg faces with a little red food coloring dissolved in water or ketchup, using the tip of a toothpick. *I scattered on some salmon caviar too, but I forgot to take a photo of it."
- "*Use a clear glass plate or a plate that&#39;s not white under the sushi cake. The lotus root &#34;lace&#34; will stand out better."

It is traditionally celebrated with chirashi sushi, which is also known as mixed or scattered sushi. Chirashi sushi is also referred to as bara sushi in Japanese, but what differentiates this layered sushi is that some might refer to it as a festive. Why don&#39;t you celebrate your anniversary with Fancy Sushi Cake and Japanese Strawberry Sweet Mochi? We make a party sushi cake decorating with Japanese fresh Seafoods &#34;SASHIMI&#34; and vegetables. And Winter is best season for strawberry in Japan, so I would like many foreign tourists to try strawberry sweet mochi in my class. 

Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
