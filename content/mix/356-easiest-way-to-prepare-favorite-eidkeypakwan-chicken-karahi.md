Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
