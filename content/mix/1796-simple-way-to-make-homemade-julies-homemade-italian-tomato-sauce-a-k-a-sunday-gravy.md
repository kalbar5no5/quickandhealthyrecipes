Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
