How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
