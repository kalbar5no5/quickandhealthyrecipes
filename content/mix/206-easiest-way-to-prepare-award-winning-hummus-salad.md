How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
