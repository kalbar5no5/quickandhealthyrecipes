Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
