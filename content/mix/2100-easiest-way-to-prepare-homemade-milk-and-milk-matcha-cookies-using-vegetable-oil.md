Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
