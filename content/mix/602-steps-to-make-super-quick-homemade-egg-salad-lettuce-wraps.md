Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
