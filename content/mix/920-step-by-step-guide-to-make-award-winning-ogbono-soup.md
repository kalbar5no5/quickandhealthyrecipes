Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
