Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!
