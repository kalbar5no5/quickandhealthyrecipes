Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
