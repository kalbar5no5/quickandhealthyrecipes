How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
