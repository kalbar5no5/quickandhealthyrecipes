Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
