Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
