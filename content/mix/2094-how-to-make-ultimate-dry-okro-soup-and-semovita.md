Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
