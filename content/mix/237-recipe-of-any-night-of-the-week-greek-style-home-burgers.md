Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
