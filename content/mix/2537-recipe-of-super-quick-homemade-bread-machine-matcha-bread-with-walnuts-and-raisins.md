How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
