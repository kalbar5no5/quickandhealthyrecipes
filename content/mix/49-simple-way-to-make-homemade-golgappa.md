Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
