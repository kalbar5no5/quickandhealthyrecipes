Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
