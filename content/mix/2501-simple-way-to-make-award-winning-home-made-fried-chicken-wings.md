Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
