Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
