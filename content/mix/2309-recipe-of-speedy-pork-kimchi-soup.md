Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
