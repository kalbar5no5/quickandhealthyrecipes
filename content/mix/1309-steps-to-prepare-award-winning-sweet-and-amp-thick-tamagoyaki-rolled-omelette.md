- "When the egg has set a little, start rolling it from the near side while popping any air bubbles with cooking chopsticks."

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
