Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
