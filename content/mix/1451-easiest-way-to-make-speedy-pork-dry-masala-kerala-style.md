Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
