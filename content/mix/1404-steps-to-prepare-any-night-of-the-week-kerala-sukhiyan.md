Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
