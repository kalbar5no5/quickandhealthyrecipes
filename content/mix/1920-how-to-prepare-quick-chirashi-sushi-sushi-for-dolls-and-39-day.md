Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
