Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
