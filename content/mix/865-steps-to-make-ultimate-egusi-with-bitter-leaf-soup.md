Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
