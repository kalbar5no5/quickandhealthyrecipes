Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
