Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
