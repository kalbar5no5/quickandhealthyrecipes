Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
