Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
