Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
