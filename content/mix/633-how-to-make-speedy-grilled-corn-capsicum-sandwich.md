Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
