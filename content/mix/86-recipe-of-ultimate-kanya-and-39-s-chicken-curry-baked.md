Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
