Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
