Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
