Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
