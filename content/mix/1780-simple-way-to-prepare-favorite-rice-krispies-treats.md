Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
