It usually weirds people out in the States because of its &#34;processed&#34; figure; but I really enjoy its chewy, rubbery texture, and its flavor of the sea.

It is made from white fish paste (called surimi) that has been pureed and then steamed, grilled, or fried until fully cooked and firm.

Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.
