Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
