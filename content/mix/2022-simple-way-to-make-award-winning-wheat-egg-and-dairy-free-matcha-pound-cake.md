If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood.

Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them.
