Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
