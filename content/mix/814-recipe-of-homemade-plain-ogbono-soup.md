Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
