Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
