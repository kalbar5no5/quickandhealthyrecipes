Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
