Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
