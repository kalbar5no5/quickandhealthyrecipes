Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
