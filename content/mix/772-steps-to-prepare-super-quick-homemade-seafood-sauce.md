Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
