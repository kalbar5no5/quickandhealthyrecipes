Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed.
