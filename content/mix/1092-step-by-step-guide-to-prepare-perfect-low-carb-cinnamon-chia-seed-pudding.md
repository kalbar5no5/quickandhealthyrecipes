Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
