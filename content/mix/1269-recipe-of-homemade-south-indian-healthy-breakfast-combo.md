How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
