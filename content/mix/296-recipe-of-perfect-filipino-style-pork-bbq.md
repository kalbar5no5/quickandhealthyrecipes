Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
