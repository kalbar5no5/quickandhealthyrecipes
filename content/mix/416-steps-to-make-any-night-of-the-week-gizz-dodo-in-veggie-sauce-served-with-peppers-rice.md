How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
