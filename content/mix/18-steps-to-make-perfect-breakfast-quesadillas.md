Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
