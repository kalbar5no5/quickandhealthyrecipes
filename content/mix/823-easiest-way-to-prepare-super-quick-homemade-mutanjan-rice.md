Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
