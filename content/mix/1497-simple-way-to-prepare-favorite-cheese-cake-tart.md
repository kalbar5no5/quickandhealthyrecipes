Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
