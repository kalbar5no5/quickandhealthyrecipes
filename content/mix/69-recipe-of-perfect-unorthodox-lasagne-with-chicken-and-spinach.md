Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
