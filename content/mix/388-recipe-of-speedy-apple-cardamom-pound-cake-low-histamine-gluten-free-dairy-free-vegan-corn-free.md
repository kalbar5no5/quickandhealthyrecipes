Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
