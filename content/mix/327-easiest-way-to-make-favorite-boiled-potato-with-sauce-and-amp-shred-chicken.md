How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!
