Chikuwa and Nori Seaweed Fritters (Isobe-age) Made in a Frying Pan When I had a little leftover egg from making rolled omelettes and felt it a waste to throw it out, I quickly thought thi. more &#39;Isobe&#39; means &#39;Rocky Beachside&#39; in Japanese, and &#39;Isobe-age&#39; is a type of Tempura made with the batter with a flavour of sea. Most commonly &#39;Aonori&#39; (Dried Green Laver Flakes) is added to the batter, but it might be difficult to find.

Coat the half chikuwa&#39;s with the batter. Great recipe for Mentaiko-Filled Chikuwa Isobe-age (Nori Seaweed Flavored Fritters). I thought this up to use up some mentaiko. Recipe by Orange Day Chikuwa Isobeage, perhaps a mouthful to pronounce for non-Japanese speakers, is Tempura Chikuwa (a kind of fishcake) flavored with Aonori (dried seaweed flakes). This deep-fried dish is often a side dish item in commercial Bento, but also a great home-made appetizer that goes well with drinks. 

Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
