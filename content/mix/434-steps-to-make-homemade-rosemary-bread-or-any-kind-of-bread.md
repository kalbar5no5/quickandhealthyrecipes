Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
