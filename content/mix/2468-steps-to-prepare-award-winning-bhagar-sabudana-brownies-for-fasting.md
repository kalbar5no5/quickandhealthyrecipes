Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
