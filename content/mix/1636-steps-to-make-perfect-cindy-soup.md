Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
