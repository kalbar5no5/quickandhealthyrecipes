Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
