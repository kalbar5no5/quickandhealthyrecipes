Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
