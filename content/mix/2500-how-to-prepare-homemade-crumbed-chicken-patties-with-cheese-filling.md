Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
