These cinnamon sugar twist doughnuts are a cross between crunchy churros and soft, fluffy beignets. Shape the dough into twists, punch out rounds, or slice them into squares. But these doughnuts — perfectly crisped in oil and coated in sugar — won&#39;t last long at all. These were meant to be twisted korean doughnuts but instead of cinnamon, I decided to add my Nigerian twist with some sprinkle of nutmeg powder and they are still delicious.

Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
