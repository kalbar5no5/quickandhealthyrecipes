Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
