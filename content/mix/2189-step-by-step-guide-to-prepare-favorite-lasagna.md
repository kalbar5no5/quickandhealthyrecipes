Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
