Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
