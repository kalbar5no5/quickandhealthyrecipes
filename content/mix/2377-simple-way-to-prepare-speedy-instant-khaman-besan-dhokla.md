Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
