How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
