Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
