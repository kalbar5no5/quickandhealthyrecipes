Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
