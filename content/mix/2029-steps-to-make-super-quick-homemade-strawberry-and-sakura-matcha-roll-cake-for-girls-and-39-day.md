Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
