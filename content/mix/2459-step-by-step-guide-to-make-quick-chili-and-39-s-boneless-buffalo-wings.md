Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
