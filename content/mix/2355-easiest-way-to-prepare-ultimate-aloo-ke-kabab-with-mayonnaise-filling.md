Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
