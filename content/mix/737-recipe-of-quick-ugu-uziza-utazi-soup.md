Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
