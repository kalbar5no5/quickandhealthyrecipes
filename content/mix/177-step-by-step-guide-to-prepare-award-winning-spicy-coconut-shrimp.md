Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
