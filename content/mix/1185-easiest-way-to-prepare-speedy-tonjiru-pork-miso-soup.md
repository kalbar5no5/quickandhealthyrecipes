Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
