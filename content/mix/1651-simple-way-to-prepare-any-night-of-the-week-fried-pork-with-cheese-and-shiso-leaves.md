Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
