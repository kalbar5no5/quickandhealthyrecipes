Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
