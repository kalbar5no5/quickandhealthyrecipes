Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
