Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
