Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
