recipeingredient:
- "2 ham hocks"
- "2 cups or more cubed ham"
- "1 lb. navy beans"
- "1 yellow onion diced"
- " carrots handful of baby diced"
- " couple cloves of fresh garlic minced"
- " salt and pepper"
- " rosemary and thyme"
- " parsley and a couple bay leaves"
- " dry mustard"
- " white vinegar"
- " water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare dry beans according to package, either soaking overnight or doing quick soak. Drain and add to a stock pot along with the ham hocks and ham cubes. Add approximately 8 to 10 cups of water, diced onion, diced carrots, minced garlic, and seasonings, to taste. Bring to boil, then turn down and simmer on low covered several hours. I let mine go maybe 4 hours or so. Note: I add the seasonings to taste. A pinch here, a shake or splash there. See, I am really no help, lol!!"
- "After you are done simmering and your beans are tender, remove the ham hocks and bay leaves from your pot. You can use whatever ham you can get off of the ham hocks."
- "Make your dumplings. I use maybe 4 eggs beaten, a little salt, and keep stirring flour into the eggs to get a semi stiff, yet sticky consistency. Drop by teaspoonfuls into boiling water and they will float when done. Drain and add to your soup."
- "You will have to keep playing with your seasonings. My rule of thumb is add a little at a time so you don&#39;t overdo it! I find adding a little vinegar and dry mustard gives the soup a better flavor. Dad always liked vinegar in his bean soup and I add extra to my own bowl at times. You can also add more or less ham and dumplings. My husband likes a heartier soup so I tend to add more. Enjoy!!"

Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
