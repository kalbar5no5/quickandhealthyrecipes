Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
