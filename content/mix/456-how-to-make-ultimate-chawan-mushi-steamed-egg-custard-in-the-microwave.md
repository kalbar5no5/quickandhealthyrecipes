Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
