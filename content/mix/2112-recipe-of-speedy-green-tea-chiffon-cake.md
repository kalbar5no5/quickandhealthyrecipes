Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
