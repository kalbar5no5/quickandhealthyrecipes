Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood.

The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest.
