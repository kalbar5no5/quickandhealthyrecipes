This basic recipe can be made into a garlic or chili flavored spread as well.                                                               * 3 You can serve this spread with jams or jellies, assorted sharp - light cheeses and Prosciuttos.

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
