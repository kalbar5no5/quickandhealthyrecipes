Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
