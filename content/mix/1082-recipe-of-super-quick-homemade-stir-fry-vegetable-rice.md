How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
