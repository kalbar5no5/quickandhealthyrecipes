Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
