Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
