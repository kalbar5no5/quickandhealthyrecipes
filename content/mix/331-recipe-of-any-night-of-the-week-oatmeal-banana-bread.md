Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
