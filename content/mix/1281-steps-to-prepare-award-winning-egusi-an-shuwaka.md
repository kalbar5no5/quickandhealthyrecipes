Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
