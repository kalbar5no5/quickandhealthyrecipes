Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
