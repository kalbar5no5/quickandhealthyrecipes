Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
