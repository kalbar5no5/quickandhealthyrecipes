Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
