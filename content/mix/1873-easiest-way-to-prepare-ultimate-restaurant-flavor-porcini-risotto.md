Marcella Hazan&#39;s Risotto with Funghi Porcini Leaving aside the traditional risotto Milanese, risotto with funghi porcini is my favorite. The exquisite flavor of the porcini mushroom makes for a memorable meal. It turns out to be a simple, subtle and very satisfying dish. My favorite is with mushrooms - usually porcini or chanterelles - and sometimes I go with the seafood.

It turns out to be a simple, subtle and very satisfying dish. My favorite is with mushrooms - usually porcini or chanterelles - and sometimes I go with the seafood. But, if you can splurge (or find more affordable porcini somewhere), I highly recommend you use them if you&#39;re making this recipe. They are very delicious and their strong nutty flavor really makes this dish outstanding! Not to mention they have a high protein content, which means you get to serve this risotto as a main dish if you want. 

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
