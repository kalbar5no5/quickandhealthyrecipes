Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
