Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
