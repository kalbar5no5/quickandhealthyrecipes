Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
