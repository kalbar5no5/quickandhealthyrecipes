Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
