Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
