Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
