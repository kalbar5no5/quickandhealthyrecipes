Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
