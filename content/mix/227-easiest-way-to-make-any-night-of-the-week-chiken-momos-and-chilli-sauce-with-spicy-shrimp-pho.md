Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
