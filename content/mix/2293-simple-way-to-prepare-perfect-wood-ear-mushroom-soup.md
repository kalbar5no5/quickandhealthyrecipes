Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
