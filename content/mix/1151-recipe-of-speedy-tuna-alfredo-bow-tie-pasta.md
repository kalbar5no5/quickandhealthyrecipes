Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
