Hello everybody, it is me again, Dan, welcome to our recipe site. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, pickle dip. It is one of my favorites. This time, I'm gonna make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Pickle Dip is one of the most favored of recent trending meals in the world. It is enjoyed by millions every day. It is easy, it is fast, it tastes yummy. They're nice and they look fantastic. Pickle Dip is something that I've loved my entire life.

Buy Groceries at Amazon &amp; Save. Mix sour cream, cream cheese, pickles, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, and dill weed together in a bowl. Stir dill pickle juice into the dip in small increments until it meets your personal taste preference. In a large bowl combine cream cheese, pickles, sour cream, and pickle juice.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can cook pickle dip using 4 ingredients and 1 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Pickle Dip:

1. Prepare 6-8 dill pickles (I take the skin off the pickle)
1. Make ready 1/2 lb corned beef
1. Get 2 cream cheese - softened
1. Get 3 Tbs Worcestershire sauce


Scoop the dip into a serving bowl and top with additional green onions and dill pickles for garnish if desired. Stir in dill pickles, onion, pickle juice, dill weed, salt, and pepper until evenly distributed. It is important to remember that the dip will thicken as it rests in the refrigerator before serving so be sure to add enough liquid to keep it smooth so you don&#39;t end up with a chip-wreck! Dill pickle dip is basically a cold creamy dip that is flavored with chopped up dill pickles as well as pickle juice (i.e. pickle brine).

It is important to remember that the dip will thicken as it rests in the refrigerator before serving so be sure to add enough liquid to keep it smooth so you don&#39;t end up with a chip-wreck! Dill pickle dip is basically a cold creamy dip that is flavored with chopped up dill pickles as well as pickle juice (i.e. pickle brine). The amount and intensity of pickle flavor really depends on the pickles you use. I have a ton of homemade pickles that I grew and canned myself last summer, but store bought pickles will work just fine! All you need are three ingredients, and a box of crackers for serving! 

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
