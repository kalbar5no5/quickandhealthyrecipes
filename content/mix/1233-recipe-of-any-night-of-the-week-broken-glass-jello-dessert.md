Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
