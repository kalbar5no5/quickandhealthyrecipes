Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
