Flatten with bottom of glass moistened with water and dipped in sugar. Whisk together flour, baking powder, soda and salt. Beat together with mixer at low speed - butter and sugar until the sugar granules are not visible. Grandma Cook baked cookies one at a time. She checked each cookie for loft, chewiness, and crunch, adjusting the recipe with a teaspoon more of flour or an extra egg yolk, until she had the perfect cookie. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
