Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
