Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
