recipeingredient:
- "1 large egg"
- "1 tbsp hummus"
- "1 tsp dijon mustard"
- "1/8 tsp cayenne or chili powder"
- "1 tbsp onion finely minced"
- "1 leaf coarsely chopped lettuce"
- "1 bunch green salad OR 1 pc toasted rice bread  tortilla"
- "1/4 tsp olive oil optional"
- "1 tbsp shredded mozarella cheese optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "On a small pot, fill with water about 5-6 cups (just enough to cover egg). Bring water to boil. Place egg on a spoon or laddle to submerge it at the boiling pot of water and turn down heat to medium. Let egg boil for 8 mins. Turn off heat, and let the egg rest on pot for at least a minute."
- "While the egg is boiling, toast your rice bread or rice tortilla, OR alternatively prepare your vegetables for salad."
- "While the egg is resting on pot, chop half of a small onion then place them on a small bowl. On the same bowl add hummus, dijon mustard, cayenne / chili powder, and olive oil (optional). Set it aside for a bit."
- "Fish out the egg from pot using laddle or spoon. Cool it through running water until bare hands can handle it. You don&#39;t want it too cold -- we want its heat to melt mozarella a bit for later."
- "De-shell the egg (careful it might still be hot) and place it on the same bowl of the premade mixture. Coarsely mash it, add shredded mozarella, then add 1 leaf chopped lettuce. Mix them well."
- "Serve the egg salad mix as toasted bread toppings, or as salad dressing. Enjoy!"

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
