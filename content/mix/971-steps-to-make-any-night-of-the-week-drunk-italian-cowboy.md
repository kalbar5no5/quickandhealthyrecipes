Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
