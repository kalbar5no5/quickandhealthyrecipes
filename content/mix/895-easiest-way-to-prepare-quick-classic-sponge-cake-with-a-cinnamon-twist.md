Sponge cakes are not only delicious, they can also be beautiful. 

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
