Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
