Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
