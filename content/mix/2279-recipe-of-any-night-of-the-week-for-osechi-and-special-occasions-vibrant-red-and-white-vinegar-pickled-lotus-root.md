Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
