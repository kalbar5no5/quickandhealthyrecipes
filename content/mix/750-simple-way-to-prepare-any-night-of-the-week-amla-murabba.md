Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
