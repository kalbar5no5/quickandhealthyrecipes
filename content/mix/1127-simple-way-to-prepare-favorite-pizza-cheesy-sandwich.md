How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
