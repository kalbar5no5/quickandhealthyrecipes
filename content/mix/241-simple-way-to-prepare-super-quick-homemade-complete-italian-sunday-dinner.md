Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
