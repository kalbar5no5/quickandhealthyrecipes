How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
