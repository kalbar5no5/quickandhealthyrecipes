Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
