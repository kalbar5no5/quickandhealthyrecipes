Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
