Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
