Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
