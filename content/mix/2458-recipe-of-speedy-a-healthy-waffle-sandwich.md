Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
