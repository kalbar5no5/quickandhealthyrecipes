How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
