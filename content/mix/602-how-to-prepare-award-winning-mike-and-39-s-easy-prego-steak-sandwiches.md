Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
