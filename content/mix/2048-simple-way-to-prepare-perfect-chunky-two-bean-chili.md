Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
