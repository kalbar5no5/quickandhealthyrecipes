How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
