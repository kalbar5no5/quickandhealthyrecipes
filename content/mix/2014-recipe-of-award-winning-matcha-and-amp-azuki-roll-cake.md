Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
