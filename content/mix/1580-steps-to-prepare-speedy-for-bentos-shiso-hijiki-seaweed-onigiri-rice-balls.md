Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body.
