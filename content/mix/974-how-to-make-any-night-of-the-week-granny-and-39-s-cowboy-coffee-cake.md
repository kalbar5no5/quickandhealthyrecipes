recipeingredient:
- "2 1/2 cup allpurpose flour  sifted"
- "2 cup packed brown sugar"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "2/3 cup shortening ie Crisco"
- "2 tsp baking powder"
- "1/2 tsp baking soda"
- "1/2 tsp ground cinnamon"
- "1/2 tsp ground nutmeg"
- "2 eggs  beaten"
- "1 cup buttermilk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly grease and flour a 9x13x2 in. cake pan. Set aside."
- "In a large bowl combine sifted flour, salt, brown sugar and shortening with pastry cutter or fork until it looks crumbly (mostly pea-sized crumbs). Set aside 1/2 cup of this crumb mixture to sprinkle over top of batter later on."
- "To remaining crumb mixture, add baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and nutmeg. Mix to combine with wooden spoon."
- "In a medium bowl beat together eggs and buttermilk. Add to crumb mixture and gently stir until just combined with no dry spots (it will still look lumpy because of shortening pieces, this is ok)."
- "Pour into prepared cake pan (you may have to gently spread into corners). Top with reserved crumb mixture and bake in preheated oven for 25-30 minutes (check after 25). The middle will not rise much, or may look sunken in. This is normal with coffee cakes. To ensure doneness, insert a toothpick. It will come out clean if the cake is done."
- "Optional mix-ins to crumb topping: additional 1/4 tsp cinnamon or chopped nuts of your choice (I like pecans)."
- "Notes: You can sub softened butter for shortening, but I stick with shortening for this recipe. I would not use margarine. Using shortening gives it a lightness and crumb that even butter can&#39;t match. You can also sub soured milk for buttermilk, but buttermilk is much easier and tastier in my opinion."

Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
