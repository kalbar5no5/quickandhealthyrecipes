How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
