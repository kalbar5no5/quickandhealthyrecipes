Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
