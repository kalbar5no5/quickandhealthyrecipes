Very popular in Hungary but also in other parts of Eastern Europe, this stew can be served with bread, pasta, like spaetzle, boiled or roasted potatoes and pickles. It is a very hearty dish that works best for chilly days. We call this recipe &#34;American Goulash&#34; because even though it is called goulash, it&#39;s not the Hungarian version with paprika and whole cuts of meat. It goes by a lot of different names: SLUMGULLION, AMERICAN CHOP SUEY, JOHNNY MARZETTI (just to name a few.) This is my husband&#39;s Grandma&#39;s recipe for this classic favorite.

Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
