Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
