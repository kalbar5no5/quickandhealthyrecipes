Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
