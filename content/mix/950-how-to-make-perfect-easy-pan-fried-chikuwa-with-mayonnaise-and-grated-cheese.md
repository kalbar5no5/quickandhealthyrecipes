Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
