Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
