Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body.
