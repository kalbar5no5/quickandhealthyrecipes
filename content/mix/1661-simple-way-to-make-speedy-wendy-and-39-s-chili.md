Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
