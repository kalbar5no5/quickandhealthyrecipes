Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
