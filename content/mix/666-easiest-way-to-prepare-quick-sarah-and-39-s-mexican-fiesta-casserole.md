Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
