Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
