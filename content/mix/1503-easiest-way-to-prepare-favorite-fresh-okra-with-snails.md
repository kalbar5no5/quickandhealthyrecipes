Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
