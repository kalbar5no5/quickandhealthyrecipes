Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
