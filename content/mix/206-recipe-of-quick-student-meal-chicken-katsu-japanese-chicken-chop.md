Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
