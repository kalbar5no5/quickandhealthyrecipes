Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
