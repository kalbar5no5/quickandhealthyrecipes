Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!
