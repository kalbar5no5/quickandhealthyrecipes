Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
