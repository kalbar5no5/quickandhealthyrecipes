Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!
