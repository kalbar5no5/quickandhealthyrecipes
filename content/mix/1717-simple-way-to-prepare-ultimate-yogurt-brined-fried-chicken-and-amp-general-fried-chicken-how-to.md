- "3-3.5 teaspoons kosher salt"
- "2 teaspoons dried thyme"
- "2 teaspoons dried sage"
- "2 teaspoons onion powder"
- "2 teaspoons paprika"
- "1.5 teaspoons garlic powder not garlic salt"
- "1.5 teaspoons sugar"
- "1/2 teaspoon black pepper"
- " For the dredge"
- "2 cups flour"
- "1/2 cup corn starch"
- "2.5 teaspoons salt"

- "2 teaspoons paprika"
- "1.5 teaspoons garlic powder not garlic salt"
- "1/2 teaspoon black pepper"
- " Other"
- " vegetable or peanut oil for frying"
- " tongs for turning chicken safely"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix all brine ingredients in a large bowl and stir or whisk until all the salt and sugar have been dissolved."
- "In a large mixing bowl, combine the chicken with yogurt brine and gently toss and massage everything together until the brine is evenly distributed throughout. It&#39;s a good idea to check each individual piece of chicken to ensure it&#39;s been thoroughly coated."
- "Refrigerate the chicken and let it brine/marinate for at least 2 hours and up to 24 hours."
- "45 minutes before frying, take the chicken out of the fridge and let it come up in temperature. While it&#39;s doing that, prepare the dredge by combining all dredge ingredients in a large mixing bowl or casserole dish and stirring or whisking several times to evenly distribute all the seasonings."
- "10 to 15 minutes before frying, fill your large pot or pan (I like to use my wok, but you can use a Dutch or French oven, or a deep-ish cast iron skillet) to about 2/3 capacity with frying oil and preheat the oil over medium high heat to 350F to 365F. If you don&#39;t have a thermometer, you&#39;ll know the oil is ready for frying as soon as a good pinch of flour dropped in sizzles gently but immediately."
- "Line a sheet pan or large platter with a brown paper bag or a double layer of paper towels and set it on the counter next to the stove."
- "Working in batches of 3 to 4 pieces, coat the chicken completely with the dredge, shake off the excess, and gently slide the chicken into your oil. And again, if that flour doesn&#39;t begin to gently and immediately sizzle upon hitting that oil, resist the urge to let it fry anyway, and let the oil come up in temp before you put the chicken in."
- "I like to put similarly sized/same type pieces in together, largest ones first. That way, a) each batch finishes cooking at roughly the same time and b) the larger pieces that have been fried first will retain heat longer while the smaller pieces are finishing up."
- "Generally speaking, I find that thighs take longest - 15 to 18 minutes total, 7.5 to 9 minutes per side, and drums, whole wings, and breast pieces take 12 to 15 minutes total, 6 to 7.5 minutes per side. Don&#39;t forget to flip midway! :)"
- "When it&#39;s time to take the chicken out, using your tongs, gently shake off excess oil, and set it on your lined sheet pan or platter. And that&#39;s it! Looks like a lot, but it&#39;s pretty simple. The yogurt really does help to make moist, tender, flavorful fried chicken. :)"
- "Enjoy! :)"

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
