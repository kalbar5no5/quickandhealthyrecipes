Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
