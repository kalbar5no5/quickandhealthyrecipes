Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
