Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
