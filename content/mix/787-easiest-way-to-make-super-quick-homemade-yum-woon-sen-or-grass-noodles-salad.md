Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
