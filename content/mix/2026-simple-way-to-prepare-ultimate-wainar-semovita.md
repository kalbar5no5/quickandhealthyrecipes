Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
