Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
