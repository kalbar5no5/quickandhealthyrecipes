Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
