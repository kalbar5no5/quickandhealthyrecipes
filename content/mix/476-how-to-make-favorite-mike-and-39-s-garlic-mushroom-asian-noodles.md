Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
