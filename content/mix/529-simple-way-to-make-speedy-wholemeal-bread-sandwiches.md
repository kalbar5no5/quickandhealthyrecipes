Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
