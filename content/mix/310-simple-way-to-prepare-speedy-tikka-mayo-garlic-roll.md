Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
