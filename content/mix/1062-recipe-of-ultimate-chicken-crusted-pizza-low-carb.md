Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
