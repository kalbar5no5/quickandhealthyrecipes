Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
