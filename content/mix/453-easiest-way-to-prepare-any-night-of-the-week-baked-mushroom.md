Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk.

These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them.
