Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
