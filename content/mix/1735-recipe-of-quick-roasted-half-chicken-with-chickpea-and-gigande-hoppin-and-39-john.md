Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
