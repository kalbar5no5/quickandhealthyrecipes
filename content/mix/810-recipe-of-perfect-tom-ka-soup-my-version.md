Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
