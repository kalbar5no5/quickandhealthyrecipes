How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
