Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
