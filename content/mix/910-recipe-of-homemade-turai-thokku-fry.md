Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
