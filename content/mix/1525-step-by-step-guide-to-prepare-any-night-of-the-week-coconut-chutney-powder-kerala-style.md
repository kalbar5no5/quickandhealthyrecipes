Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
