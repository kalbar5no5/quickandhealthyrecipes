Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
