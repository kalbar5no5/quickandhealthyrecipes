Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body.
