recipeingredient:
- "200 grams Bread strong flour"
- "2 tbsp Sugar"
- "1/2 tsp Salt"
- "30 grams Unsalted butter"
- "140 ml Milk"
- "25 grams Black tea leaves see below"
- "1 tsp Instant dry yeast"
- " For the apple filling"
- "70 grams Apple"
- "1 tbsp Light brown sugar or white sugar"
- "5 grams Butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put 140 ml of milk and the tea leaves in a small pan and heat. Use small chopped tea leaves."
- "When the milk comes to a boil, turn off the heat and cover. Leave to cool."
- "Pour the milk into a measuring cup, tea leaves and all. Add milk up to the 140 ml mark if needed."
- "Make the apple filling. Cut the apple into 1 cm dice."
- "Put the apple, sugar, and butter in a pan, and sauté."
- "When the butter and sugar have melted and everything is well mixed, simmer over medium-low heat until there&#39;s no liquid left in the pan, stirring occasionally."
- "When the liquid is gone and the apple pieces are translucent, slightly golden brown, and glossy, the filling is done. Leave it to cool down completely."
- "Put everything but the yeast and apple in the bread machine pan. Put the yeast in the yeast compartment, and press the start button."
- "The baking program differs depending on the bread machine. Choose the one that lets you add the apple halfway through, and also lets you take the dough out after the first rising..."
- "...so that you can form the dough in the way you like. Press Start."
- "When the machine beeps, open the lid and add the apples. Restart the machine. (A Panasonic Home Bakery machine re-starts automatically after 3 minutes.)"
- "After the program is done (1st rising), take the dough out of the machine."
- "Measure the dough and divide into 9 pieces. Lightly roll each piece into a ball. Ref: With about 450 g of dough, you can can make 9 portions that are about 50g each."
- "Cover the dough balls with a moistened kitchen towel so they don&#39;t dry out. Leave to rest for 10 minutes."
- "Press down evenly on each ball on a work surface or between your hands to deflate them."

- "Cover the dough with plastic wrap and leave to rise at 105°F/40°C for 15 minutes. (Preheat the oven to 105°F/40°C in advance.)"
- "After letting the dough rise in the oven for 15 minutes, take it out and let it rise at room temperature for about 10 to 15 minutes. (This is because the oven needs to be preheated to bake the bread.)"
- "Preheat the oven to 375°F/190°C, starting as soon as you take the baking sheet out."
- "The dough should rise to about 70-80% of the height of the muffin cups. It&#39;s the same if you let them rise at room temperature for the whole 2nd rising."
- "Bake in a 375°F/190°C oven for about 14 minutes. Transfer the baked bread on a cooling rack. When they&#39;ve cooled down, they&#39;re done!"
- "If you have the type of bread machine where the yeast is added to the baking pan, be sure to keep it away from the salt."

Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
