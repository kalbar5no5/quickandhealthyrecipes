Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
