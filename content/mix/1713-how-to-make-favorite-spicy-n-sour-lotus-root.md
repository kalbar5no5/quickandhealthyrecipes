Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
