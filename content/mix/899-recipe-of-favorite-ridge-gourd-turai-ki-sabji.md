Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
