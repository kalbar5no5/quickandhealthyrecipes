Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
