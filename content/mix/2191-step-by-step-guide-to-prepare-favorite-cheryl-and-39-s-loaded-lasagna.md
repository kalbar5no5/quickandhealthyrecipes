Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
