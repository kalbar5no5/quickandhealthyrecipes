How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
