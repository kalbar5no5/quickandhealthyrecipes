Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
