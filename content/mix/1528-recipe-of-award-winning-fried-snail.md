Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
