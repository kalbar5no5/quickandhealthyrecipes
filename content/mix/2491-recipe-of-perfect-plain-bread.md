Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
