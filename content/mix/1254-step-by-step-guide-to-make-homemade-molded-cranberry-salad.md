Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
