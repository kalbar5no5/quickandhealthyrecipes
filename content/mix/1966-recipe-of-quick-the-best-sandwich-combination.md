Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
