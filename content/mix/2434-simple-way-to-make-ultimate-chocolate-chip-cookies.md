Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
