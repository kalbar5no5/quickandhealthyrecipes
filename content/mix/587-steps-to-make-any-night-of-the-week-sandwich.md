Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
