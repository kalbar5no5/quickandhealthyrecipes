Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
