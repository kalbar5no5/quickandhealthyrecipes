Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, reduce to a simmer and cook. For the best chicken soup, I use chicken thighs. Chicken soup is better when made with darker meat. Chicken thighs become tender and soft in the soup â€” similar to how the chicken turns out in our recipe for shredded chicken. Chicken breast doesn&#39;t tenderize and stays firm in the soup. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
