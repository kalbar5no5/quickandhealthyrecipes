How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
