Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
