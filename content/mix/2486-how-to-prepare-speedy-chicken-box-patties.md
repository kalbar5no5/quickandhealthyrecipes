Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
