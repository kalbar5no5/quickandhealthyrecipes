Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
