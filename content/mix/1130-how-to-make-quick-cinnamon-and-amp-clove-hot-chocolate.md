Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
