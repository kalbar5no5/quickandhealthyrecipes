Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
