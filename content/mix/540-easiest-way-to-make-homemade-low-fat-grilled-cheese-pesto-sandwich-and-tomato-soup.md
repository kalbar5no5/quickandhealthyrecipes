Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
