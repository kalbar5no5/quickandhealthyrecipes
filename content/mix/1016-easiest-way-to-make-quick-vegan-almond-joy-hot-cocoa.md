Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
