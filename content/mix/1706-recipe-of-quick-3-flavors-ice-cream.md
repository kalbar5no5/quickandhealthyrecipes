Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
