Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
