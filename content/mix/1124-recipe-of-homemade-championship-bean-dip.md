There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood.

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood.

Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.
