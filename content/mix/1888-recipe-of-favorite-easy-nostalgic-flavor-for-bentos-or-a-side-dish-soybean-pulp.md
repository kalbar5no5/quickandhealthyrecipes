Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
