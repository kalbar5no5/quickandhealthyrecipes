The dish is named after the train in the Bicol region of the Philippines, known for its spicy food. Bicol Express is a popular Filipino dish in which the slices of pork meat is cooked with coconut milk, shrimp paste, and chili pepper. There&#39;s a belief that this dish was adapted from a Bicolano dish called &#34;Gulay na may Lada&#34;, meaning &#39;vegetable with chili&#39;. Pork Bicol Express has the entire characteristic that I enjoy in a pork dish. It is tender, creamy, and tasty. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
