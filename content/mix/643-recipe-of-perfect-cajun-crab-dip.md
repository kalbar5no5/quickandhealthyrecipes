Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
