![Dem Gizzards](https://img-global.cpcdn.com/recipes/6013197334085632/751x532cq70/dem-gizzards-recipe-main-photo.jpg)

Hey everyone, hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, dem gizzards. It is one of my favorites. This time, I'm gonna make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

A gizzard is a muscle found in the digestive tract of a chicken. If you&#39;ve ever seen chickens pecking away at the ground, they are in fact swallowing tiny bits of grit and gravel, which travels through the chicken&#39;s digestive tract and eventually lodges in the gizzard. Drain and chop into bite size pieces. Put the gizzards in a bowl and pour the vinegar over them.

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
