How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
