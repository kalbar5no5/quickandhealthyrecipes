Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
