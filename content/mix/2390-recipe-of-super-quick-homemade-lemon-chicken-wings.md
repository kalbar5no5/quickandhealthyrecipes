Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
