Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
