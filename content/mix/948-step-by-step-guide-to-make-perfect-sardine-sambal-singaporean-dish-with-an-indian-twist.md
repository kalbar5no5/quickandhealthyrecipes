Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
