Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
