Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
