Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
