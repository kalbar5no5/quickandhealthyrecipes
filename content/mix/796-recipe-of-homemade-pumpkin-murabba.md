Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
