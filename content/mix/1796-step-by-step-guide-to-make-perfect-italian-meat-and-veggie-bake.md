Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
