Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
