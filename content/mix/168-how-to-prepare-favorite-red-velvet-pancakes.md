- "Add one or two splashes of milk. I used 2% milk (personally), mix by hand. I mixed with a simple spoon. there will be small lumps of butter and that is fine. mix until there isn&#39;t many but they will not be of any harm. you can probably mix with your mixer to make your mixture smoother, if not you&#39;ll be fine."
- "Once griddle is hot, pour on your mixture until you&#39;ve reached your desired size."
- "Allow them to cook just as you would any pancakes. Until it bubbles on the top and flip. I recommend 2-3 minutes each side but keep an eye on them as it may not take as long. you don&#39;t want them to cook too long."
- "Once they are done I like to drizzle then with an homemade icing made from cream cheese."
- "I&#39;m not sure if this recipe works with any other pancake and red velvet mixes. I wanted red velvet pancakes and gave this a try and they came out PERFECT for me and my boys. A great alternative to making them completely from scratch. I truly hope you guys enjoy."

Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
