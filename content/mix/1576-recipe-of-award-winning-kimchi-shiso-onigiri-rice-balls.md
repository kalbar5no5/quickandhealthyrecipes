Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
