It is a dump and go kind of chili and uses only one pot to make. It is so simple and has SO much flavor. Classic Chili Ingredients There&#39;s a big debacle on the internet whether classic chili has beans or no beans. In my opinion, the best chili recipe is a base of ground beef, tomato, spices, and BEANS. I love the number of fiber beans add to this dish and I promise you won&#39;t regret adding them. 

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
