Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
