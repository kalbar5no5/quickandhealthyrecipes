Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
