Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
