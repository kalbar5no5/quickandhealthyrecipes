Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
