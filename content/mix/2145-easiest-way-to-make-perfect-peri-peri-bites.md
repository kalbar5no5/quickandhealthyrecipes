Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
