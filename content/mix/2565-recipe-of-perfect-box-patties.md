Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
