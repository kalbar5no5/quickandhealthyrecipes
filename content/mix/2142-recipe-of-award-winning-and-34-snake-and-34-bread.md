Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on.

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine.
