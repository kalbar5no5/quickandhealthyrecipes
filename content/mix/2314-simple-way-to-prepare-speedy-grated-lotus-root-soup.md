Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
