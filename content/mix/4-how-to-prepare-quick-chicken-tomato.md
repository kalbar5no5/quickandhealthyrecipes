Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
