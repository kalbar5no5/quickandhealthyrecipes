Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
