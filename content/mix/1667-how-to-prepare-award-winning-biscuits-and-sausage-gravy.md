Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
