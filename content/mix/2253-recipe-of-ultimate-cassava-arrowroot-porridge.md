Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
