Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
