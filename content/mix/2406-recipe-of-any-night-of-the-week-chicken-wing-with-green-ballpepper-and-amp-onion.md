Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
