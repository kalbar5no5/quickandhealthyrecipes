Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
