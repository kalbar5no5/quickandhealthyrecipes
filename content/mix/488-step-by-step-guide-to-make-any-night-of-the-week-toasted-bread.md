On a recent trip to San Francisco, I couldn&#39;t get enough of the legendary toast at The Mill, Josey Baker&#39;s place in the city&#39;s Western Addition. Place your slices of bread on a baking sheet. They may need a little longer if the bread was frozen when you started. For darker toast, leave the bread in a little longer, but don&#39;t let it burn.

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
