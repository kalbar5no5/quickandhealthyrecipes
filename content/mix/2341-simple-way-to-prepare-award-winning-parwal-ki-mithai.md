Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
