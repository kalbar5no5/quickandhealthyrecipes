Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
