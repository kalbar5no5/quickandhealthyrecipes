Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
