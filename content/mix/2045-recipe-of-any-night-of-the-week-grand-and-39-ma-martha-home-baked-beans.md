How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
