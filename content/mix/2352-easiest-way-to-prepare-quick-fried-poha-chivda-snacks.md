Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
