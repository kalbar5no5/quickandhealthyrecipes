Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
