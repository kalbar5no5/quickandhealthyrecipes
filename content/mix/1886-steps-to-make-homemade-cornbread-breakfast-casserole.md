How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
