Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
