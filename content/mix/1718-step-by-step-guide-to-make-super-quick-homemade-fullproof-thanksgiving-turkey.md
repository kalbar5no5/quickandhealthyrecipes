Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
