Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
