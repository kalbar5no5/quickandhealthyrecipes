Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body.
