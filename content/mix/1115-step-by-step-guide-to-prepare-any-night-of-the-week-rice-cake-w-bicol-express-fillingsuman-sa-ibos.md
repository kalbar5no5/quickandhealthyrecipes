Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!
