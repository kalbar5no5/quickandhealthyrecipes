Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
