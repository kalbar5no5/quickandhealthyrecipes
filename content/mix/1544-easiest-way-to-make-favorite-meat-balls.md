Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
