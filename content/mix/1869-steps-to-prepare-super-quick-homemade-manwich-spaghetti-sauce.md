Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
