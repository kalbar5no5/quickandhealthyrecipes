Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
