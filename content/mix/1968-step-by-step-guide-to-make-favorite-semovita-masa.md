Today i am going to talk briefly about the Calories in Semovita, so you can adjust and d your calculations when you are planning your meals. Semolina is a high-gluten flour made from hard durum wheat. It has a rather coarse texture, yellow color, and is high in gluten protein. The high gluten content means the flour is especially well suited for making pasta, but this flour is also a common ingredient in bread and baked goods as well as couscous.

Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
