Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
