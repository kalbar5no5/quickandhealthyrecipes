Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
