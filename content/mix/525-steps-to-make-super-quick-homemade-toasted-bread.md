Place your slices of bread on a baking sheet. They may need a little longer if the bread was frozen when you started. For darker toast, leave the bread in a little longer, but don&#39;t let it burn.

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
