Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
