How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
