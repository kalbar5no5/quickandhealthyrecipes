Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
