Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
