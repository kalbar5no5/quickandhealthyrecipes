How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!
