Hey everyone, it is Brad, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a special dish, ham and bacon cheese ball. It is one of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Put all chopped ingredients in bowl with cream cheese and fold into cream cheese. Add milk to allow mixture to be softer and easier to dip when chilled.

You get that nice punch of dijon, worchestershire sauce, and garlic, that when spread on a pita chip and getting a bite or two of the ham, well, need I say more?

Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
