Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
