Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
