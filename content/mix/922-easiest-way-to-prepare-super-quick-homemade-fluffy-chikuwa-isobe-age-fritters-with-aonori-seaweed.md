Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
