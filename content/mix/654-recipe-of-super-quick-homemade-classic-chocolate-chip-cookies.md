Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
