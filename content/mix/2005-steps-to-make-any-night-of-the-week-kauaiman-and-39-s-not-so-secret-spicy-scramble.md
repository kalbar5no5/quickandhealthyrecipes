That&#39;s right, I started my journey way back here.; Bon Appetit, who not only wrote a nice post about soft scrambled eggs, but also. Which is to say, it&#39;s a wonderfully versatile sauce that packs just the right amount of cayenne. The scramble should look softly set and slightly runny in places. Even though you&#39;ve taken the pan off the heat, the eggs will still continue to cook (that&#39;s carryover cooking). 

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
