Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
