How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
