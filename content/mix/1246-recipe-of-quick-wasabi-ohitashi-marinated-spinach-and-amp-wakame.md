Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
