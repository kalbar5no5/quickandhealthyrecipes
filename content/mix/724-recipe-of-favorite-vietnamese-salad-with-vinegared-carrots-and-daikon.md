Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
