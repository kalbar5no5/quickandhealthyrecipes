Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
