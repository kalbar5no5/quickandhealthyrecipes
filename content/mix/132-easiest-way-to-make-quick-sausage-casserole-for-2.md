Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
