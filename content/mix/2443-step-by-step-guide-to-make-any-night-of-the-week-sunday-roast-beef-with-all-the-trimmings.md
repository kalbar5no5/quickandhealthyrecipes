recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 200*C fan. Spray the bottom of the roasting tin/dish with oil."
- "Rub the spices all over the beef, making sure to evenly coat it. Place the beef in the roasting dish and cover the whole dish with tinfoil. Place in the preheated oven to cook for 1 hr 30min, but be sure to take the tinfoil off with 15 minutes to go. This timing will make a medium-rare roast. Adjust your timing accordingly."
- "While the roast is in the oven, prepare all the vegetables. For the potatoes, peel and chop in half. Boil them for 20minutes."
- "While the potatoes are boiling, peel and chop the carrots, swede, and parsnips into inch pieces. Set aside."
- "Prepare the Yorkshire Pudding mixture. Combine the flour, egg, and milk. Whisk until mixed through. Pour into 8-12 cupcake tins. Set aside."
- "When you can pierce the potatoes easily with a form, drain them from the water. Place them into a roasting tin and cover them with olive oil, pinches of salt, and pinches of rosemary. When there is about an hour left on the roast: Pop the potatoes into the oven with the roast for 45minutes. Be sure to turn them every 10-15minutes to make most of the potatoes nice and brown."
- "While the potatoes are roasting. Begin to boil the carrots/parsnips/swede for about 30minutes, until very fork tender."
- "Now is a good time to cook up the asparagus! I like to roast them. So place them in a roasting dish and cover them with olive oil, salt and, rosemary. Put them in the oven (for 15minutes) to roast when there is 15 minutes left for the beef to cook! Rotate the asparagus occasionally."
- "Put the yorkshire puddings in the oven now (about 12minutes left on the roast) Be sure to give them room to rise. They should take between 9-13minutes to rise and set. We burnt ours a little! Whoops!"
- "By now the carrots/swede/parsnips should be ready to mash! Drain the water out and place them in a bowl. Mash together with a 20 grams of slightly salted butter. Some people also add in a dash of milk, but as we are allergic we avoid it."
- "By now the oven should be beeping and demanding your attention :) Check the asparagus, yorkshires, potatoes, and beef are properly cooked. You should be able to put a fork in the asparagus, the yorkshires will have risen and browned slightly (we burnt ours a bit!), the potatoes should like nice and brown, and the beef should be pink in the middle (if rare)."
- "Serve up and enjoy! We ended up using store bought bistro gravy, but homemade is always better! I will put up a recipe soon for it."

It was always a large one made in a large pan, then cut into squares for serving. Suet dumplings were served with lamb. A rib or beef or a fillet are the Rolls Royce choice, but out of the question for most of us on a regular Sunday. Topside looks the part and has a good flavour, though it is best roasted at most to. Traditionally, the Sunday roast comprises beef, veggies and Yorkshire puds. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
