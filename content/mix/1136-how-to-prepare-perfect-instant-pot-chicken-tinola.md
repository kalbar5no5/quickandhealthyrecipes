- "I used whole chicken and cut it up using only dark meat."
- "Peel the chayote, and then cut each in half starting at the ridge at their bottoms. Remove the soft seed in their centers. Slice off any remaining skin on the ridges of each chayote, and then slice them into small enough chunks that will allow them to cook fast."
- "Take the bok choys, cut off their end stems, and then wash them thoroughly. Wash spinach thoroughly. Set aside."

- "Add green peppers and the chayote. Mix well, and make sure all the ingredients are submerged in the liquid."
- "Secure the lid onto the pot, and then cook for 12-15 minutes with the vent open. After letting it cook, press “Cancel” and then wait for all the pressure to release from the vent before opening the lid. (**Be quick on the next step so that your soup is still hot enough to soften the bok choy!)"
- "Take one of the chayote and poke it with a fork to see if it is soft enough to eat. Then, season with the fish sauce (adjust to your liking). If needed, add some salt to enhance the saltiness of the soup."
- "Add and fully submerge all the bok choy leaves and spinach. Wait a few minutes for them to cook and soften. Now it’s ready to serve!"

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
