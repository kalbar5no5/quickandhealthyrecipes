Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
