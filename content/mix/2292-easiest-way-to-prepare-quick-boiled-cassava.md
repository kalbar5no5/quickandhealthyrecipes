Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
