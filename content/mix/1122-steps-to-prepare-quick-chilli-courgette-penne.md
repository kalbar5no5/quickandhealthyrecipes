Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
