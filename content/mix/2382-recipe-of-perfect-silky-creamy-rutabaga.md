Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
