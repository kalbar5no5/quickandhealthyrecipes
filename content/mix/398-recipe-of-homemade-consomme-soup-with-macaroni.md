Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
