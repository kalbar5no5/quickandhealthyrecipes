Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
