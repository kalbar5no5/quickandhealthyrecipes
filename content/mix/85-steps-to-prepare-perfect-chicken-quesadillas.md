Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
