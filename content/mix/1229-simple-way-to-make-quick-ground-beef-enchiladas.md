Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
