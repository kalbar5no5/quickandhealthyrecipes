Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
