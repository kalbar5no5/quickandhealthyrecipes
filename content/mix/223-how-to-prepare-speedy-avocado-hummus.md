Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
