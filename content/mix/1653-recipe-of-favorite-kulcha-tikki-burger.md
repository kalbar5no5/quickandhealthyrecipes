Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
