Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
