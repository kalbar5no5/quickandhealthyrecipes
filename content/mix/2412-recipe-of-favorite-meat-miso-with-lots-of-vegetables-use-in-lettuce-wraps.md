Lettuce wraps are a savior if you still want to eat burgers and wraps while watching your calories. They don&#39;t work as well as bread does, but some types of lettuce are better than others. Butter Lettuce Lettuce wraps are such a fun, interactive way to eat, especially when you&#39;re trying to avoid the carbs in more traditional wrappers, like lavash or bread. While lettuce wraps are usually associated with Asian fillings, try them with baked falafel, taco or fajita filling, or instead of a bun around your next burger. So I buy this really good lettuce wrap fillings at my local Safeway, and obviously serve it with lettuce, and usually I make a batch of veggie fried rice. 

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
