Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
