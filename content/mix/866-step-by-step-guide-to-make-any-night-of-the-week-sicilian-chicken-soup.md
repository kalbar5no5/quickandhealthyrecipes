Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
