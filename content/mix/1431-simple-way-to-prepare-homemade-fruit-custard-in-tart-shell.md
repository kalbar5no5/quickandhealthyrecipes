Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
