Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on.

The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine.
