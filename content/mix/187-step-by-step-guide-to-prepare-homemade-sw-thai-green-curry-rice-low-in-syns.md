Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
