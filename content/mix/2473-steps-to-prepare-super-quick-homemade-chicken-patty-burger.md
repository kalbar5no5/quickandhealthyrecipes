Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
