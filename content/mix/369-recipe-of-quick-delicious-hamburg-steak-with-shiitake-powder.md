Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
