Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
