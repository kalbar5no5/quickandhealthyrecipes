You can add the chopped herbs now or sprinkle them on the scrambled eggs before serving. Creamed Eggs on Toast is the perfect breakfast or brunch for when you have a bunch of hard-boiled eggs on hand, or when you don&#39;t have a lot in your pantry. Hard-boiled eggs are served in a creamy flavorful sauce and poured over crisp hot buttered toast. Whether you&#39;re making it by the slice, or in an oven-baked casserole, French toast is pan-fried bread that&#39;s been soaked in a mixture of eggs and dairy. That mixture is actually a custard, and it tastes best when you use full-fat dairy (whole milk, half-and-half, or equal parts milk and heavy cream). 

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
