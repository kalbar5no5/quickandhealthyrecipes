Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
