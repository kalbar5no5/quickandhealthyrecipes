Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
