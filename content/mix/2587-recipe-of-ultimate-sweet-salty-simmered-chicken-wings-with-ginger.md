Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
