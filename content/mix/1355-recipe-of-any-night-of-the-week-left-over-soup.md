Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
