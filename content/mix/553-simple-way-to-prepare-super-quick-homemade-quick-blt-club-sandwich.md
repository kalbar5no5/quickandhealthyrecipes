Watch how to make this recipe. Place a baking rack on a sheet pan and arrange the bacon on the rack in a single layer. A BLT is a tomato sandwich, seasoned with bacon. From this basic premise, all else follows. Indeed, a better name for the BLT might well be the Tomato Club, for it is the perfect tomato, not the bacon, that is the rarest, the most ephemeral, the most singularly delicious ingredient. 

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
