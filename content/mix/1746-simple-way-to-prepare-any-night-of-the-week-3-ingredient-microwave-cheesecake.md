Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
