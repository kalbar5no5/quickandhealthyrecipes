Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
