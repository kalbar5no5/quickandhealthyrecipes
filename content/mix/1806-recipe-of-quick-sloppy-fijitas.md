Amanda, whats good with some sloppy toppy? Another saying for giving head or oral-sexy. In linguistics, sloppy identity is an interpretive property that is found with verb phrase ellipsis where the identity of the pronoun in an elided VP (verb phrase) is not identical to the antecedent VP. 

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
