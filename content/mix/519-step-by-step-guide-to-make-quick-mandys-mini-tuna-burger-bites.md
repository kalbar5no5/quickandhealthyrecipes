Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
