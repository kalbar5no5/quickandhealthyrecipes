Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
