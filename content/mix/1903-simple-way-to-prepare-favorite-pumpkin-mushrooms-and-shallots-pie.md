Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
