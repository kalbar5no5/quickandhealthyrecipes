Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
