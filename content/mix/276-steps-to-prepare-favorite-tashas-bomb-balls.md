Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
