Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
