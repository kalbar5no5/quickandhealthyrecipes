Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
