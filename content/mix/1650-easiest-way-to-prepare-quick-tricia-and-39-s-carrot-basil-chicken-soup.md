Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
