Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
