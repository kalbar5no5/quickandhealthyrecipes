Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
