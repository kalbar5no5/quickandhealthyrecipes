Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
