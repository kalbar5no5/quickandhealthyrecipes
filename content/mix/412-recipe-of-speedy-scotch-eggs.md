Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
