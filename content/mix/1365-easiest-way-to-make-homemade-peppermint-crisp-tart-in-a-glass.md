Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
