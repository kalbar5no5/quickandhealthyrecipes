How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
