Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
