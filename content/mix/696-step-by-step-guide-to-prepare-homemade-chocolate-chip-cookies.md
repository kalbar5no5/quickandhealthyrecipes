Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
