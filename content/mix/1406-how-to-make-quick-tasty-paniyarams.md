Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
