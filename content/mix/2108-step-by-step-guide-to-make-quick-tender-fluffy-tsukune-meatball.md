Tender Fluffy Tsukune Meatball If you marinate the meatballs in the sauce, you cannot store the leftover sauce for sanitary reasons. If you are storing the sauce over a long period of time, it would be more sanitary to keep the sauce separately and use only as needed. Meatballs for Tsukune have to be soft, bouncy and juicy. To make the texture of the soft and juicy Tsukune, you need to have chicken fat in the mince.

Wet your hands with cold water to mix and shape meatballs - use a light touch to keep the meatballs tender. Last night we served the sweet and sour sauce beside our meatballs along with brown and wild rice pilaf, carrot and apple salad and green beans. A meatball made of just meat would definitely be fine, but adding some kind of texture and variety to your meatball makes the whole eating process much more enjoyable. No matter what meat you choose, the binder -- the mixture of bread and milk or water -- is the key to a tender meatball. Meat proteins shrink during cooking, which means meatballs without a binder may become tough. 

How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
