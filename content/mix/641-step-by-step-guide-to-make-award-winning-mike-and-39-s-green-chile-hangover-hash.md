Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
