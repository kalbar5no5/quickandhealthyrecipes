Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
