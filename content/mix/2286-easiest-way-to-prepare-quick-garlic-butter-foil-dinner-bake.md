Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
