Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
