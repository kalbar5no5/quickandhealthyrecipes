Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
