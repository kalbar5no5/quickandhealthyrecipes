Semolina, Fufu, Amala, Tuwo Masar a and Tuwo Shinkafa are popular bolus meals eaten with Nigerian soups. These bolus meals are available in form of powder/flour and quite easy to prepare once you have the flour ready. From time to time, I substitute any of them with wheat flour or wheat meal whenever possible. 

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
