Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
