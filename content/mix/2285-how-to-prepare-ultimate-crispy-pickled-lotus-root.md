Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
