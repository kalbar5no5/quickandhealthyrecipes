How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
