Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
