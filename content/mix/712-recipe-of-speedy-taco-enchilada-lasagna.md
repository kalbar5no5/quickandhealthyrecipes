recipeingredient:
- "3 lbs ground beef"
- "1 pack authentic corn tortillas can sub flour but corn works better"
- "2 packs taco seasoning"
- "2-3 green onion"
- "1 yellow onion diced"
- "2 bottlecan enchilada sauce"
- "1 LARGE bag Mexican shredded cheese"
- "2 tsp diced garlic"
- "2 tbls cumin powder"
- "1 container pico de gallo"
- " Sour cream"
- " Fresh cilantro chopped"
recipeinstructions:
- "Brown the beef. Drain fat. Add about 2/3 cup water, onions and garlic and the packets of taco seasoning. Cook until all ingredients are cooked together and hot on medium heat giving the onions and garlic time to soften a bit. About 8-10 more mins. Set to the side to allow it to cool."
- "I used an 11x7 glass baking pan. 13x9 can also be used. Grease the dish. Put down a layer of shells. I try to cover as much of the area as possible without overlap which means you&#39;ll have to pull a couple tortillas in half, even quarters. See pic."
- "Now we&#39;re going to layer, like lasagna. I do a layer of enchilada sauce first. Thinly covering the shells.  Next spoon the cooled taco meat on top of the sauce. Next cover the meat with a healthy layer of cheese. I LOVE cheese so I do a REALLY healthy layer. Now this is where the secret method comes in.. On the cheese layer gently sprinkle some of your cumin powder directly onto it. Then sprinkle some of your chopped fresh cilantro in the same way."
- "Repeat step 3 till you reach almost the top of the baking pan. You should be looking at the cheese/cumin/cilantro layer. The top layer will pretty much be the same--  Do another layer of tortillas. Sauce Cheese (Only cheese for top layer, no cumin or cilantro) Top the finished pan with your chopped green onion."
- "Cover pan loosely with tin foil. Loosely because you don&#39;t want the cheese sticking to the foil. Put in middle rack of oven at 375 for 20-30 mins If it&#39;s not as melted as you&#39;d like, uncover and continue to bake until desired doneness. The objective of the oven is not to cook, just to melt everything together and make it hot."
- "Cut into square pieces, use a spatula to dish out a piece onto a plate or shallow bowl, top with the pico de gallo (diced tomato, onion, jalapeño and cilantro) and sour cream and enjoy!!"

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
