Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
