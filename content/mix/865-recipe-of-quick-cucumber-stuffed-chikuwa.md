Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
