Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
