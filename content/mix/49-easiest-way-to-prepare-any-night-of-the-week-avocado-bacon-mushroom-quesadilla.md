Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
