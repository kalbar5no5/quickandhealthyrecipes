Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
