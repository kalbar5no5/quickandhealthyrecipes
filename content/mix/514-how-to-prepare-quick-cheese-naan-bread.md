In the bowl of a stand mixer (or a large mixing bowl) combine the flour, yeast, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together. Homemade naan bread, garlic butter, fresh herbs, and cheddar cheese are all cooked together to create a simple, but delicious grilled cheese sandwich. They each have yeast raised dough. The difference between the two is that Naan is usually made with an egg and yogurt base that thickens and gives it a different texture when cooking. Place ham on naan bread; top with Cheddar cheese. 

Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
