Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
