Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
