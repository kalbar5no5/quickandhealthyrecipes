Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
