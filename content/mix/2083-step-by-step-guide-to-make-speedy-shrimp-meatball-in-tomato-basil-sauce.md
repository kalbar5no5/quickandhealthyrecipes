Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
