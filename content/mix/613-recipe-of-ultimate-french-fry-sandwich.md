How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
