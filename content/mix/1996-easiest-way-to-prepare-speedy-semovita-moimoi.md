Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
