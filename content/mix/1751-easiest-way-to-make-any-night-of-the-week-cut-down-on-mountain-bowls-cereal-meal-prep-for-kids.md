Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
