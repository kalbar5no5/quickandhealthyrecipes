Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
