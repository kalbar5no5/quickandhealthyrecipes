Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
