Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
