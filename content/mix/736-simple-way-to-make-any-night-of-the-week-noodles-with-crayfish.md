Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body.
