Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
