How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
