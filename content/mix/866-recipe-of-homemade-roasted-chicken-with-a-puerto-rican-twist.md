How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
