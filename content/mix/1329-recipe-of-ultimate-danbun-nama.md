Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins.

These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine.
