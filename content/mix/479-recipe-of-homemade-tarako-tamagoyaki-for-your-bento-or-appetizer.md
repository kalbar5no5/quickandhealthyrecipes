Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
