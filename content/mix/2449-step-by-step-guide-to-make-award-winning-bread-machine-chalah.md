Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
