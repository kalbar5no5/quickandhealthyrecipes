Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
