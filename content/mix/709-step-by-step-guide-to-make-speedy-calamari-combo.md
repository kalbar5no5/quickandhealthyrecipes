Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
