recipeingredient:
- "1 cup dry instant rice 2 cups when prepared"
- "3 large bell peppers  any color we like red for these"
- "1 lb lean ground beef lighter option ground turkey"
- "1 tbsp olive oil"
- "1 small yellow onion  finely chopped"
- "2 tbsp finely chopped bell pepper"
- "1/2 tsp salt"

- "1 tsp dry oregano"
- "1/2 tsp garlic powder"
- "1 can condensed tomato soup"

- "3 slice cheese of your choice we like Colby Jack or pepper jack"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare instant rice to package directions. When done set aside for later."
- "Bring a large pot of water to a boil, make sure water is deep enough to cover peppers. This is to parboil  your peppers which helps get them nice and soft in the oven, without becoming mushy or overcooking the filling."
- "While waiting on water to boil cut tops off peppers. Use tops (without stems) to chop and reserve 2tbs for later. Remove seeds and clean up insides of peppers. If your peppers can&#39;t &#34;stand up straight&#34; trim the bottoms just enough to create a flat surface without cutting a hole through the bottom. Then, fill a large bowl with ice and water (this is their &#34;ice bath&#34;)."
- "Gently place peppers in boiling water, submerging completely. Let boil for 1-2 minutes. Gently use a slotted spoon or tongs to remove peppers from boiling water, allowing excess water to drain back into pot, and transfer to the prepared ice bath immediately, submerging completely, to stop the cooking process."
- "Remove peppers from ice bath. Set aside upside down on paper towels to drain. Meanwhile preheat your oven to 375°F and make your filling."
- "Heat a large sauce pan over medium heat (to save dishes I just use the pot I boil the peppers in even though it&#39;s a little bigger than needed). Add 1 tablespoon oil, chopped peppers and chopped onion. Cook until just tender, about 2 minutes."
- "Add ground beef, salt and pepper to pot. Brown ground beef, breaking up into fine pieces while cooking. When cooked through, turn off heat, drain in colander (do not rinse) and return to pan."
- "Stir into meat the dry oregano, garlic powder, can of tomato soup and cayenne pepper. Mix until incorporated then gently fold in cooked rice. Taste mixture and adjust salt and pepper to taste."
- "Place bell peppers in a casserole dish open end up. Fill each to &#34;heaping&#34; with meat and rice mixture, packing it into the cavity as you go."
- "Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove from oven, place one slice of cheese on top of each pepper and return to oven for 5-10 minutes more or until cheese is melted. Remove from oven and let rest for 5-10 minutes."
- "Alteration: Swap the cheese for a swirl of ketchup covering the tops for a dairy free option! Put this on BEFORE baking and extend time to 25-30 minutes (the total time you would bake when using cheese)."

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
