Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
