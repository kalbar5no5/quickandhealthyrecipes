Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
