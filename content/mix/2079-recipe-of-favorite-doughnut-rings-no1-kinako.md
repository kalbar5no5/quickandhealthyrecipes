Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
