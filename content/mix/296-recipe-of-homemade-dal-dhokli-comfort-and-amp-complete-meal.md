Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
