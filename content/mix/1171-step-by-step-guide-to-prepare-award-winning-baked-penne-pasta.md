Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
