Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
