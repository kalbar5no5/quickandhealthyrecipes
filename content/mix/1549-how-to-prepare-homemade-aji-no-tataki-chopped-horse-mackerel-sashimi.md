How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
