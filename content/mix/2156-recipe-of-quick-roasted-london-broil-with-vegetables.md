Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
