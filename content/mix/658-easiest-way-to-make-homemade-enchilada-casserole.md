Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
