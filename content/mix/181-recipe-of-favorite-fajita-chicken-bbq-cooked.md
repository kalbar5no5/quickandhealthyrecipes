Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!
