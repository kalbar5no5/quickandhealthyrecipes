Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
