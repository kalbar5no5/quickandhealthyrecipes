Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
