Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
