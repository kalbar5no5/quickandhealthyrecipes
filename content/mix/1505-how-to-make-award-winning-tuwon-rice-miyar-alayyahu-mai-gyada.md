Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
