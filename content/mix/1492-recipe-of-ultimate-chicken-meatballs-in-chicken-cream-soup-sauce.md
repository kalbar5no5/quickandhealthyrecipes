Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
