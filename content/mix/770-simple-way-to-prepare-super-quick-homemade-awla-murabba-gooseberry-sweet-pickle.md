How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
