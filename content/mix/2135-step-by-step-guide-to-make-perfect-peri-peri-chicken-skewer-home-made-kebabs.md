Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
