Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
