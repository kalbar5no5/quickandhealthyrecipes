Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
