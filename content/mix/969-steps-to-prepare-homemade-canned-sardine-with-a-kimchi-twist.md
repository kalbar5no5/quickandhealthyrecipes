Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
