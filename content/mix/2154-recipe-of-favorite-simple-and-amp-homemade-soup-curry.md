recipeinstructions:
- "Before, this recipe called for a frying pan and a pot, but I&#39;ve improved it so that you can make it in just one pot!"
- "Cut the potatoes and carrots into large pieces. Cut the chicken into pieces of even thickness. If using boned meat, insert the knife between the meat and the bone."
- "To help reduce the cooking time, place Step 2 into a heat-resistant container, add vinegar, cover with plastic wrap, and microwave at 600W for 6-8 minutes. You don&#39;t have to cook everything through."
- "Make the roux. Add the ● ingredients to the pot and cook on low-medium heat until the roux dissolves."
- "Once dissolved add the ◇ water a little at a time to soften the roux. Once it&#39;s softened add the remaining water and the other ◇ ingredients."
- "Add your microwaved vegetables from Step 3, together with the juice, to the pot from Step 5. Add the ☆ ingredients and simmer until the potatoes soften (about 5 minutes)."
- "Use salt and soy sauce to adjust the flavor, and garam masala to adjust the spiciness. You can substitute ichimi pepper or red pepper. Use chutney (left in the picture) to add sweetness, or substitute honey."
- "You can find chutney in the curry corner of your supermarket for about 100 yen. Frozen is also okay. It definitely makes for a better flavor than honey!!"
- "Transfer the finished soup, potatoes, carrots, and chicken to a dish. Top with deep-fried vegetables or whatever fillings you like and it&#39;s complete."
- "Let it sit for a half day to a full day and it&#39;ll become even more delicious. Make the soup in the morning, then all you have to do is fry the vegetables at night."
- "Try adding a small amount of oyster sauce or fish sauce as a delicious hidden ingredient."
- "I made naan bread in a toaster. I recommend adding melting cheese to the center before stretching out the bread, for cheese naan."
- "Add rice, saffron, salt (a small amount of each) to your rice cooker to make saffron rice."
- "Recommended fillings 1: Potatoes, carrots, weiners, shimeji mushrooms, chicken wings. Boil everything together. Pictured is a chunk of pork belly."
- "Recommended fillings 2: Eggplant, lotus root (add after washing to remove scum), pumpkin, green pepper."
- "Add the chicken wings, potatoes, and shimeji mushrooms to the bottom in a pyramid shape, and then pour the soup in."
- "Then place the carrots, green peppers, eggplant, etc on top. Cut the egg vertically. Then add your pepper last for a restaurant-like feel."
- "To eat, you can add the soup to rice. Or add rice to the soup. Or mix the filling in with the rice. There&#39;s lots of different ways to eat it, and all of them are good."
- "If you have any soup left over you can use it the following day in a risotto, or with noodles. Enjoy this down to the last drop!"

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
