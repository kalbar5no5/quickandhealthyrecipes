Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
