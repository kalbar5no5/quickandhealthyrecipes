Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!
