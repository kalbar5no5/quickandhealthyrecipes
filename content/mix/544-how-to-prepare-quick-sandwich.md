Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
