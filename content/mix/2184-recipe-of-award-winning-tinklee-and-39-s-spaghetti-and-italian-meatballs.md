Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
