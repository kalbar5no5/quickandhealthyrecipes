recipeingredient:
- "2 large pieces Chicken breast"
- "4 tbsp  Sake"
- "1 tbsp  Salt"
- "1/2 tsp  Umami seasoning"
- "1 very small amount  Ginger juice optional"
- "1 Tempura flour"
- "20 Shiso leaves"
recipeinstructions:
- "Remove the skin and white fat from the chicken breast meat. Diagonally slice the chicken into bite-sized pieces against the direction of the fiber."
- "Put the chicken and the ★ ingredients in a dish, massage in the seasonings, then marinate for half a day. (Tip: The sake gets completely absorbed into the meat if you let it marinate overnight.)"
- "Chop off the stem of the shiso leaves, then cut the leaves into halves. (To make 40 pieces in total.)"
- "Prepare the tempura batter as per the instructions on the tempura flour package. Place the shiso leaves on one side of each of the pieces of chicken, and dip them into the batter with your hands."
- "Gently deep fry in 160°C oil until crispy. Keep the oil at a low temperature since heating the chicken meat at a high temperature will make the meat tough!"
- "By keeping a thin layer of tempura batter over the shiso leaf, the green color will show through and add a nice visual touch."
- "Since they also taste good cold, they make a perfect obento item. I put them on top of rice covered with a layer of nori seaweed."
- "Serve it with lemon in your obento."

Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
