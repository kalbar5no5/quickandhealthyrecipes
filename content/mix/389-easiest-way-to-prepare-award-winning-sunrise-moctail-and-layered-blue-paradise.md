How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
