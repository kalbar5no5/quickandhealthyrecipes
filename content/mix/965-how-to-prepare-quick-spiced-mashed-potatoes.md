Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk.

This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera.

The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.
