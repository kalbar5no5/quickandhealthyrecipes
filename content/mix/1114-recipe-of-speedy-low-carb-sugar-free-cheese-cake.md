Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
