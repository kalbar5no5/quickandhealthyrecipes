How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
