Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
