Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
