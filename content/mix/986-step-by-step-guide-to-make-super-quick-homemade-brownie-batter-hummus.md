Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!
