This will make a rack for the turkey to sit on, and will make cleaning the pan easier. Like some of the other families we always stuffed the bird the night before with no problems. The secret as told by my Nona was to cook the meat dressing and put it in the fridge the night before you plan to stuff the bird. Take the turkey and dressing out of the fridge salt &amp; pepper the cavity and stuff.

Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body.
