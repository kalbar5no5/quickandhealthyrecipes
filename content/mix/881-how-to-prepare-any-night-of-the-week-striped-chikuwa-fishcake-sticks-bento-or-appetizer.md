Chikuwa is already cooked and has a hole, so many moms usually put cucumber in it. All you have to do is slide a cucumber into chikuwa to create this visually appealing bento item or appetizer. Leaving the tip of the cucumber intact, moisten it and the chikuwa to make it easier to slide through. I like the texture of chikuwa fishcakes, so I was wondering if I could use it in making some dishes. Even after cooking the chikuwa, the texture remained, so it is quite satisfying. 

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
