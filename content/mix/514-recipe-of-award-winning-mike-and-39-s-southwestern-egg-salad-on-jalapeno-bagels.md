Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
