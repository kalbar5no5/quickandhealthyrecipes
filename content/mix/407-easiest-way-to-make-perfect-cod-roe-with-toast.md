Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
