Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
