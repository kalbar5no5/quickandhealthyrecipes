Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
