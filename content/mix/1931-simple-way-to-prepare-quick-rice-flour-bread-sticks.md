Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
