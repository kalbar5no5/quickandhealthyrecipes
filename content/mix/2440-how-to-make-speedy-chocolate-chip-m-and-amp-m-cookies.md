Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
