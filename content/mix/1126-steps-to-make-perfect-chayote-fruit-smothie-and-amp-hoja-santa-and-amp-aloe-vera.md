Chayote is green and pear-shaped with a white inner flesh that has a mild flavor and a texture that is often described as being somewhere between a cucumber and a potato. It&#39;s classified as a fruit but when it&#39;s used, you&#39;ll probably think of it more as a vegetable. Kind of like how we use tomatoes. When having chayote, it&#39;s best to cook it first.

Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
