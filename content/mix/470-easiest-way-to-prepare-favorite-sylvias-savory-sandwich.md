Why Is Mayo Better for Grilled Cheese? It might seem strange to use mayo to make a grilled cheese (or even to bake chocolate cake). But it makes perfect sense when you think about the ingredients used to make mayonnaiseâ€”that creamy texture comes from whipping egg yolks and oil. Using mayo instead of butter to make grilled cheese results in a rich, golden brown exterior, and some say the taste. The sharp cheddar is a staple in many sandwiches; in this lineup, it helps provide a bit of tanginess. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
