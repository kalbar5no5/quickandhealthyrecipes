Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
