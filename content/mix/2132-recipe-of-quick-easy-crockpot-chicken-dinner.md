Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
