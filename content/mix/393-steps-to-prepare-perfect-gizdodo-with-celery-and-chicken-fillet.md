Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body.
