Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
