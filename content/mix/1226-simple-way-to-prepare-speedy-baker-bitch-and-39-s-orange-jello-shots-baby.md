Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
