Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
