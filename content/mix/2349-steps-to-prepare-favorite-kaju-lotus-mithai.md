Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
