How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
