Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
