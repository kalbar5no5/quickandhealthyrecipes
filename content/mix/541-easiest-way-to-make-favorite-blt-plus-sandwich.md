- "1 package Thick cut style bacon or bacon of you prefer"
- "8 slices toasted bread"
- "4 tablespoons mayo or miracle whip"
- "1 large tomatoe sliced"
- " Salt and pepper"
- " Lettuce you prefer I used iceberg"
- "4 eggs"
recipeinstructions:
- "You can either bake your bacon (add 4 to 6 extra minutes to the cooking time for thick cut), or you can heat a skillet over medium heat and cook the bacon for about 6 to 8 minutes, turning it every few minutes until it is nicely crisp, but still pliable. Remove the bacon to paper towels to drain."
- "Over medium high heat fry 1 egg to over medium. You will need 1 egg per sandwich. If you dont know how to cook a over medium egg it is in my recipes."
- "Toast bread in toaster oven, skillet or oven. How to is in next step."
- "Spread about 1 teaspoon of mayonnaise on 1 side of each piece of bread. Spray a large skillet with nonstick cooking spray and heat over medium heat. In the skillet, place as many slices of bread that will fit, mayo side down, and griddle them up until the mayo side of the bread is nicely browned, about 1 minute. Remove the bread from the skillet, let rest browned side up, and griddle up any remaining slices."
- "Place 4 of the slices of toast browned side down on a cutting board. Place a tomato on each piece, season lightly with salt and pepper, place 4-6 slices of bacon on each slice of tomato, add cheese of your choice. Then add 1 over medium egg and top with a couple of pieces of lettuce. Generously spread the rest of the mayo on the non-browned side of the remaining slices of bread, and top the sandwiches with the second piece of bread. Slice in half and you&#39;re good to go."
- "More ideas to make your blt plus. You can add grilled or caramelized onions, or a thin slice of raw onion, swap out the plain lettuce for arugula or watercress, or a blend of lettuce. You can Change out the bacon for pancetta. You can add a slice of avocado or make a quick guac-ish mash smash up some avocado with lime juice and maybe some minced scallion or minced cilantro. Either addition is great or just make a classic blt. Bacon Lettuce Tomato sandwich."
- "Enjoy."

Tons of contrasting colors, flavors, and textures make a relatively simple sandwich a true gourmet delight. To pair with a BLT sandwich, I&#39;d go with a classic recipe with carrots, bell pepper, and celery. If you want yours to be a little sweet, stick with regular mayonnaise. Arrange lettuce on top, along with tomato and basil. Wife and I shared the BLT Plus and the Turkey and Brie sandwiches. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
