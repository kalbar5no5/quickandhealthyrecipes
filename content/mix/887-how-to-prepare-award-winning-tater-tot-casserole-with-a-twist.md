Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
