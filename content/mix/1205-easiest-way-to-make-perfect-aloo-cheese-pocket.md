Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
