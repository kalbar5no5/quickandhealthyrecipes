Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!
