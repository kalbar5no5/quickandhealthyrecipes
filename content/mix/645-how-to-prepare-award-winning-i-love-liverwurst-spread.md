I have seen various version of this spread on the internet and have always wanted to make it. Even James Beard had his own favorite version. If you LOVE liverwurst, you might not like this stuff. It is VERY fatty, with blobs of fat and/or oil. Compared to the ham and chicken, this is a read dud, just my opinion.. 

Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
