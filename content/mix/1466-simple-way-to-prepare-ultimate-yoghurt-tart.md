Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
