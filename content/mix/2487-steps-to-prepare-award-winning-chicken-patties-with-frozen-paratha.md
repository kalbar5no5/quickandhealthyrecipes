Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
