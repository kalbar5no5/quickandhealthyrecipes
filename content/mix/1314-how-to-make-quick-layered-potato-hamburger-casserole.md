Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
