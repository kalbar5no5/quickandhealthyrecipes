Barley is different than hot cereals. We love the texture of pearl barley. It is mild enough, with a slightly nutty flavor, to go with just about anything. Place one tube of crescent rolls over the butter and press together to close the seams.

Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
