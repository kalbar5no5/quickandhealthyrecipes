Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
