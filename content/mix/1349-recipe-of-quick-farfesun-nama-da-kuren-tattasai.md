Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
