Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
