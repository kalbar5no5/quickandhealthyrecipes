Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
