Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
