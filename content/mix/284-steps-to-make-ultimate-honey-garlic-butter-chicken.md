Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
