recipeingredient:
- "1 medlarge Milkfish Bangus"
- "1 medium carrot grated"
- "2-3 medium onions chopped"
- "4-5 cloves garlic chopped"
- "4 large calamansi"
- "3-4 Tbsp soy sauce"
- "to taste Salt  pepper"
- "1 egg beaten"
- " Cooking oil"
- " Needle and string"
recipeinstructions:
- "At the store, have them remove the scales and fins of the bangus or milkfish. Or do it yourself. Careful not to tear the skin of the fish."
- "Slit a small opening with your knife (2-2.5 inches) on the top (bone area), cut starting from the fish head. This is so you can remove the guts, bones, and get the meat. Experts do it just from the head/gill opening alone. This is harder, you can try though :) Cut the main fish bone attached to the head, and try to detach it from the skin. Remove the inedible guts of the fish, in the head area and just before the stomach. Place over running water to clean off the blood. Continue pulling on the main fish bone, use the back of a spoon to separate the meat from the skin. Remember not to tear the skin when you remove the bones and flesh. Leave the stomach area (black fatty part- delicious) attached. Try to get the skin inside out through the small slit you created so you can properly remove the flesh and bones. Always wash off any blood then collect in a bowl."
- "Once the fish is just all head+skin, marinate it in 1-2 calamansi juice and 1-2 Tbsp soy sauce, depending on how large your fish is. Set aside."
- "In a pot place all the fish meat and bones and cover. Cook at medium heat. Don&#39;t place water, as liquid will come out from the fish meat. Do not season yet."
- "Once cooked, remove from heat, strain and let cool. Discard fish broth or keep for use in another dish. Once meat cools, start de-boning. Remove all fish bones including thin, small ones. Those are annoying. ;)"
- "In a wok, heat oil and saute garlic, onions, and carrots. Add the boneless fish flesh. Season with remaining calamansi juice (to taste, be careful not to make it too sour), soy sauce (be careful not to put too much that it darkens the meat), salt and pepper to taste. Mix well. Adjust accordingly. Let it cool."
- "Once cool, add the beaten raw egg- Leave a little for coating the skin later. Mix well. This serves as the binder to let you easily stuff it back in to the fish skin. Don&#39;t over stuff, so it cooks well when you fry. There is a tendency for it to become mushy (mouth feel) when it&#39;s over stuffed. Once stuffed, the fish should look slender but not loose. Sew close the opening with a needle and string. Any clothes needle, string or thread will do."
- "Heat oil in an oblong pan. Oil should cover half of the fish when you lay it on the pan. Make sure it&#39;s hot enough before you put the fish in. Brush the stuffed fish with the remaining beaten egg before frying. Fry one side first. Fish should be golden on the white areas and a little blackish on the darker areas of the skin before turning it on the other side. (See photo) Once golden, serve and enjoy. You can use the remaining fish-egg mix as filling for lumpia (like spring rolls) or omelettes. :) They&#39;re delicious!"

Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
