Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
