Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
