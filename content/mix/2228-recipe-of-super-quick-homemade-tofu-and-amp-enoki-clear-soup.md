Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
