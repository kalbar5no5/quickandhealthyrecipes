Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
