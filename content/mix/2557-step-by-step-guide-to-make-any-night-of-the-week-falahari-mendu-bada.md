Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
