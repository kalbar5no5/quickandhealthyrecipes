Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
