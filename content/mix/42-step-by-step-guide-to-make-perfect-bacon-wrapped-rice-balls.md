Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
