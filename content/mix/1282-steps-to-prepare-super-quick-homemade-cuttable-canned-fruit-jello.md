Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
