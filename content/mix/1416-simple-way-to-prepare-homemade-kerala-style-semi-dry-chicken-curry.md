Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
