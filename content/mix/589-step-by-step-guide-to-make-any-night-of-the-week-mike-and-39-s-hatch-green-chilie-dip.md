Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
