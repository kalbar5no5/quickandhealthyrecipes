How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
