Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!
