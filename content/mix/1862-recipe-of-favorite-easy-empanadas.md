Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
