Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
