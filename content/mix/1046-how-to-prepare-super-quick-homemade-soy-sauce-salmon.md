Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
