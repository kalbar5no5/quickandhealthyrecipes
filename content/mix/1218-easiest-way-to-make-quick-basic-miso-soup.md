Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
