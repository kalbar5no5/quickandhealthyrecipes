Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
