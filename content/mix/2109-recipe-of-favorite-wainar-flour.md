There are different types of wheat flour, and they&#39;re distinguished by the amount of gluten they contain. The most commonly mistaken are all purpose flour, bread flour and cake flour, as they are all made from wheat. The basic difference is the amount of protein and gluten they contain, so cake flour is more finely grounded and has less gluten concentration, whilst bread flour needs to have more gluten strength. Flours from hard wheat are termed &#34;semola&#34; or &#34;grano duro&#34; (meaning &#34;hard grain&#34;).

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
