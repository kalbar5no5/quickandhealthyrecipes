Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
