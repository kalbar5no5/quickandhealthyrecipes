Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
