Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
