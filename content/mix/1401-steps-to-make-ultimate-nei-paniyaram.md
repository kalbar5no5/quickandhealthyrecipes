Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
