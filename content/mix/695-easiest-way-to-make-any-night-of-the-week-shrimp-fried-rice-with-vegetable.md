How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
