Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
