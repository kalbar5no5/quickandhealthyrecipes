Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
