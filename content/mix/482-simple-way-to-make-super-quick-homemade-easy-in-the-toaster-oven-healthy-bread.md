Turn the toaster to the lowest setting, because the bread will burn from the bottom fast on anything higher. Your simple garlic bread should be done in a minute! One extra thing to look out for when cooking bread in a toaster oven is not only that the circumference of the bread will fit the oven but that the height will as well.

How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
