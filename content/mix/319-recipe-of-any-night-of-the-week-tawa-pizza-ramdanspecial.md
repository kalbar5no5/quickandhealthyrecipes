Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
