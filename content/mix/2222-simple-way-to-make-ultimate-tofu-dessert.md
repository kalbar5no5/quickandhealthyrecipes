Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
