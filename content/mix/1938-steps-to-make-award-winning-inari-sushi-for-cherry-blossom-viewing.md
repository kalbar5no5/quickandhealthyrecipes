recipeinstructions:

- "Put all the ☆ ingredients and the aburaage in a pot. Put a small drop lid  and let it simmer for a while.  (I use a makeshift drop lid by poking holes in a circular sheet of parchment paper)"
- "Put all the ☆ ingredients and the aburaage into a pot. Place on a small drop lid  and let it simmer for a while. (I make some holes on a cooking sheet and use it as a drop lid.)"
- "Simmer it until golden brown. Drain a little bit of the seasoning sauce away but not completely. (It can dry out if you drain away too much.)"
- "Wash the salted cherry-blossoms in water quickly and soak them in water for about 15 minutes to take out the salt. Break apart the cherry-blossoms and drain them with a paper towel."
- "Put the rice in a bowl when the rice is ready, sprinkle some vinegar, mix it like you are cutting it with a rice scoop, and let it cool down. Add the lotus roots, cherry-blossoms and white sesame seeds too and mix."
- "Stuff the rice from Step 8 into the aburaage from Step 9. Stuff the rice gently after stuffing the corners of the aburaage as you open up them so that they look nice and plump but keep their softness. Fold in the open side and you&#39;re all done."
- "*Using red ginger pickles and nozawana would also give your rice a beautiful color."
- "If you keep the boiled lotus roots in the juice of red pickled ginger in some sugar overnight, they&#39;ll become pink as well."
- "&#34;Beautiful Forever! Salted Cherry-Blossom (in Plum Vinegar)&#34; would be a good choice for the cherry blossoms. You can of course use store-bought ones."

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
