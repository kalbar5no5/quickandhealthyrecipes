Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
