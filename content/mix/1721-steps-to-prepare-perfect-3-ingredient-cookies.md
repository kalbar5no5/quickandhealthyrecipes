They are light, fluffy and thick, rich cookie that has the perfect peanut butter balance. Once they are cooked golden brown in oven enjoy warm with a cold glass of milk. Made with peanut butter and oatmeal, it can be made with or without the banana and is the perfect quick and easy breakfast! I REALLY love using a European style butter in this recipe, as the fat content is slightly higher, meaning it will be that much more rich and flavorful. These unbelievably easy -- and gluten-free -- cookies have only three ingredients and are a great way to use up those extra mixed nuts hanging out in. 

How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
