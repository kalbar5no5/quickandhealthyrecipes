How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
