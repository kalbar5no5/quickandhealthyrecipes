How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
