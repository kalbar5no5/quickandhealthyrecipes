Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
