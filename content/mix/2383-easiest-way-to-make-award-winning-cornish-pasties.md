recipeinstructions:
- "For the Pastry:"
- "Mix dry ingredients into a large bowl. Add in the butter and shortening in small chunks. Mix on a stand-up mixer with a pastry extension tool. Mix on a lower setting until it becomes a uniform dough."
- "The dough should be covered with a towel and placed in the refrigerator for about 4 hours. Longer is okay."
- "Take the dough out of the fridge and divide into 6 or 7 sections on a clean, flat, floured surface."
- "Take each dough section one at a time and roll it out flat. I like to use wax paper between the dough and the rolling pin so it doesn&#39;t stick."
- "Once flat, use a round dish like a plate to shape the dough into a circle. Repeat these steps with the other dough sections."
- "You can now fill the pastries with the filling. Be sure not to fill it too full as you will not be able to fold the pastry."
- "Fold the pastry in half, carefully. Flouring your fingers and hands will help the pastry not stick to your fingers as you fold it."
- "Once folded, crimp the edges of the pastry with your fingers."
- "Brush the outside of each pastry with beaten egg. Then, make a little slit at the top of each Pasty to vent."
- "For the filling:"
- "Cut up all the vegetables. I use a large, very sharp knife. However, if you have a Ninja Food Processor or other electric chopper, I would highly recommend using it."
- "Cut up the raw meat into 1/2 inch pieces."
- "When filling the pastries, salt and pepper between layers."
- "Preheat oven to 350 degrees"
- "Place the Pasties on a greased cooking sheet. You may also line the sheet with aluminum foil."
- "Bake in the oven uncovered for about 50 minutes. If the outer crust is a light brown color, they are done."
- "Take the Pasties out of the oven and let cool for about 20 minutes. They will be VERY hot inside and will burn your mouth if you don&#39;t let them cool down properly."

Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
