Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
