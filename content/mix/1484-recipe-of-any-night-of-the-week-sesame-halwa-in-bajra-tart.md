Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body.
