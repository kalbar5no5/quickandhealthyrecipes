Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
