Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
