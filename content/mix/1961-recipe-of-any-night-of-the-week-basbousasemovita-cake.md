Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
