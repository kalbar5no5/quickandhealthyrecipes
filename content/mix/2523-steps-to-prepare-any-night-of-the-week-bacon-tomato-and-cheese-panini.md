Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
