How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
