Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
