Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
