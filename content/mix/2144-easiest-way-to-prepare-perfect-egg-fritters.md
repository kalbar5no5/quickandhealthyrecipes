How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
