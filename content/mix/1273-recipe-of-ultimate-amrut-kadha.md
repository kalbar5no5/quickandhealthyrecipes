Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
