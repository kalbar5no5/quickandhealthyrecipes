The recipe can easily be doubled or even tripled to feed all the vegetable soup fans at your table. Because this is a vegetable soup and not a &#34;beef&#34; vegetable soup, there are a few basic rules to follow though. 

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
