Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
