recipeingredient:
- "1350 grams boneless pork belly slab 3lbs skinrind on"
- "2 tbsp olive oil"
- "2 tbsp coarse  crystal salt"
- "1 onion chopped"
- "1 carrot chopped"
- "4 clove garlic peeled"
- "4 tbsp fresh sage leaves"
- "4 sprigs fresh thyme"
- "2 bay leaves"
- "3 sharp apples such as Braeburn or Golden Delicious"
- "300 ml apple cider"
- "200 ml water"
- "100 ml apple cider VINEGAR"
- "200 ml hot chicken stock"
- "1 tbsp brown sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it will go to"
- "Score the pork skin very well right through the fat with the sharpest knife you have, or ask your butcher to do it for you. A Stanley blade or craft knife works best as pig skin is like cutting through leather on top of jelly.... Don&#39;t cut into the meat though"
- "Rub the olive oil all over the pork, then pat dry and rub in the salt, especially getting into all the cuts you made on the skin. This will make your crackling crunchy. It&#39;s good to do this the day before cooking. If you set this aside in the fridge overnight it will get even better as the skin will dry more but you can roast straightaway if pressed for time"
- "Place the pork in a roasting tin, skin side up. Roast for 20 minutes or until the fat puffs up and starts bubbling"
- "Remove the pork and set aside. Drain off the liquid fat collected in the tin then toss the onion, carrot, garlic and herbs together in the tin"
- "Reduce the oven temperature to gas 4 / 180C / 350째F"
- "Peel the apples (keep the skins) and cut into wedges. Set them aside in a bowl of cold water with a squeeze of lemon juice to stop them going brown"
- "Mix the apple skins, cider, vinegar and water into the roasting tin with the veg. Lay the pork on top, skin side up. Tent loosely with foil and cook for 2 hours or until the meat is very tender"
- "Remove the foil from the pork and add the drained, sliced apples to the tin"
- "Now increase the oven temp to gas 8 / 220C / 425째F"
- "Return the tin to the oven and roast, uncovered for another 20 minutes, or until the crackling is crispy and golden. Remove the tin from the oven and set the pork aside to rest on a warm plate while you finish the gravy"
- "Put the roasting tin with the vegetables etc in it on the stove and cook over a medium heat for a few minutes"
- "Remove the apples with a slotted spoon when they&#39;re soft. Set aside but keep warm. If the liquid in the tin evaporates too quickly before the apples are done, add a little more cider. Bring to the boil and reduce the liquid by half"
- "Stir in the stock and brown sugar and reduce down again. Mash the veggies in the tin well to thicken the gravy. Mix in then strain to get rid of the herb sprigs, bay leaves and any lumps. Discard those"
- "To serve, cut the pork into 6 even pieces and serve with the apples and gravy and some mashed potatoes and seasonal veg"

Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
