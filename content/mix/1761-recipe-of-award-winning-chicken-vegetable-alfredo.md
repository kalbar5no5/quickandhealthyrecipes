Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
