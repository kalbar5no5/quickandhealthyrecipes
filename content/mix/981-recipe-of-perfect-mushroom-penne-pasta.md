Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.
