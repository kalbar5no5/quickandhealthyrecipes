Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
