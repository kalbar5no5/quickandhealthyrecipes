Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
