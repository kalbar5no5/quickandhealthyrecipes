Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
