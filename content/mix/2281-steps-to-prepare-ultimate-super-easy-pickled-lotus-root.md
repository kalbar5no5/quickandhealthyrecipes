Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
