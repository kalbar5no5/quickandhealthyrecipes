Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
