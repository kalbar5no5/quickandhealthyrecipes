My sister-in-law Lisa with her three large boys and revolving cast of visiting teenagers swears by this.

Let heat up and cook your maccaroni while doing the next steps.

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
