Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
