recipeingredient:
- "2 Eggs"
- "70 grams Sugar"
- "1 tbsp Honey"
- "80 grams Cake flour"
- "1/2 tsp Baking powder"
- "4 tsp Water"
- "1 Tsubuan chunky sweet azuki adzuki bean paste"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the eggs and sugar in a bowl and mix together. Add the honey, and beat with a whisk until it&#39;s thick and creamy. This beating is the key to the fluffy texture."
- "Sift the cake flour and baking powder together into the bowl, and mix in. Add 2 teaspoons of water, and leave the batter to rest for about 15 minutes."
- "Add 2 teaspoons of water to make the batter runny. If you add too much water, the batter will spread out too much and not turn out puffy, so be careful."
- "Warm up a non-stick frying pan over low to low-medium heat Pour in the batter from a height aiming for one spot until the batter is 8cm in diameter, and cook. When the surface of the pancake is bubbly, turn it over to cook the other side."
- "Line up the cooked pancakes on a cutting board and cover with a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel to keep them moist as they cool. By using the moist kitchen towel, you will achieve that desirable moist texture."
- "When the pancakes are cool, sandwich the anko (bean paste) between pairs so that the middle is mounded up higher than the perimeter."
- "If you have a branding iron, heat it up and press it into the surface to finish."

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
