How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
