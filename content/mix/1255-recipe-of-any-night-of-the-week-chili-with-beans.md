Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
