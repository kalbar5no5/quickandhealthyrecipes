Heat a gas or charcoal grill to medium-high heat. Steak and Shrimp Kabobs You&#39;ll make any get-together special with these attractive kabobs. Cubes of marinated steak are skewered with shrimp, mushrooms, tomatoes, green peppers and onions, then grilled. For picnics, I assemble the kabobs at home and carry them in a large container. Look for swordfish, tuna, salmon, halibut, mahi mahi, snapper or monkfish, avoiding thin or delicate fish like walleye, trout, sole and flounder. 

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
