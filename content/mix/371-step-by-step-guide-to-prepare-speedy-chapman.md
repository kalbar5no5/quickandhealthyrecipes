Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
