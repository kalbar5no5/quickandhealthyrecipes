Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
