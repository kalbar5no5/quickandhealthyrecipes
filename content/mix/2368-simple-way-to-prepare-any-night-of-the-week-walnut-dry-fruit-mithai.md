Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
