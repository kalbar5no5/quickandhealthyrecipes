Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
