Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
