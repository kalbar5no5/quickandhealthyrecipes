Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
