Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
