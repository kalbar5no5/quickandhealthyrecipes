Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
