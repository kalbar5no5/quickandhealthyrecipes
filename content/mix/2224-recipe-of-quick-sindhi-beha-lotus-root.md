Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
