How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
