recipeinstructions:
- "Heat the cooking oil in a vessel. Add in 3/4th of the sliced onions and all of the chopped green chillies with a pinch of salt and saute till onions are light brown in color. (Tip :Salt aids in quickening the process of browning the onions)."
- "Now add in the garlic paste, ginger paste and the diced tomatoes. Once the raw smell of garlic and ginger is gone, add in 1 cup of chopped coriander leaves and 1/2 a cup of chopped mint leaves and leave for a min."
- "Now add in the masalas - turmeric powder, chilli powder, coriander powder and one spoon of garam masala powder. (It&#39;s best to make a paste of the masalas with a little bit of water and then add the paste in)."
- "Add in the whole spices - 3 cardamom pods, 3 cloves, a cinnamon stick and 3 black pepper seeds and mix well. When you see an oil layer floating on the top, it indicates the masala is cooked."
- "Now you add in the yoghurt / set curd / set dahi. Mix well and let it heat a bit but do not bring it to a boil."
- "Add in the cut chicken pieces and coat each piece well with the masala. Reduce flame, cover and cook for about 30 min. (If you are using a pressure cooker, keep it for a whistle). The chicken masala should be in a semi-paste form."
- "Paralelly, while the masala is busy being ready, soak the rice in water with salt for about 20 min."
- "In another vessel (which will be used to cook rice), bring water to boil. Add in the remaining mint leaves, coriander leaves, cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, crushed pepper seeds, salt and the lemon slice."
- "Add in 2 tbsp of ghee to the boiling water and the pre-soaked rice. Cook on medium flame and bring it to a semi-cooked stage (8-10 min). Drain and keep the rice aside. (Tip: Grate about 1/2 a carrot into the water alongwith the rice. Not only does it give color, but adds to the flavor as well)"
- "In a frying pan, heat 2 tablespoon of ghee and add in the remaining sliced onions. When they start to turn brownish, add in the chopped cashew and raisins. Sprinkle the remaining garam masala powder and salt on top of it all, mix well, and turn off the heat once cashews start changing color."
- "In a large aluminum vessel, spread about a tablespoon ghee on the bottom. Layer about a half of the semi-cooked rice on top of the ghee. Sprinkle half of the fried onion-cashew mixture on top of this layer."
- "Layer the chicken masala prepared earlier on top of the rice layer. Dump the remaning semi-cooked rice on top of the chicken masala layer. Sprinkle the remaining fried onion-cashew mixture on top alongwith the remaining ghee. Add few coriander and mint leaves as well."
- "Cover the vessel with a lid. It should be tightly closed so as not to let any steam escape. This can be done either by using an aluminium foil paper and wrapping around the lid area or using a dough made of plain flour/ all - purpose flour / maida."
- "Place the vessel on stove on medium flame for about 2-3 min. Reduce the flame and keep it for 20-30 min. Remove from heat and serve hot."

Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
