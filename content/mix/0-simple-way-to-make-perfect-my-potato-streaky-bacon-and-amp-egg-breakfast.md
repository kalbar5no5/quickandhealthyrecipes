Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
