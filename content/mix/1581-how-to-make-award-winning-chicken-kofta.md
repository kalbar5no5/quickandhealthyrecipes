Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
