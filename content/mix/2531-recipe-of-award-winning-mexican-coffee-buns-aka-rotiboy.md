- "Let rest for half an hour or until the dough has doubled in size."
- "Meanwhile, beat buter and sugar in a bowl until pale and fluffy."
- "Beat in egg and stir in the coffee."
- "Sift the flour into the mixture and stir gently until corporated. Do not over work it."
- "Pour the cookie batter into a piping bag with the tip snipped off."
- "Pipe the cookie batter in circles on the bread dough before baking it in preheated oven at 180℃."

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
