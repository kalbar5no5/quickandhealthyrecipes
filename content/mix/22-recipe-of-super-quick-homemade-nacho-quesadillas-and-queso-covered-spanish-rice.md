Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
