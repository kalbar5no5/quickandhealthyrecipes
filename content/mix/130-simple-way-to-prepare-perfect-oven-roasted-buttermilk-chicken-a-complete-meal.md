Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
