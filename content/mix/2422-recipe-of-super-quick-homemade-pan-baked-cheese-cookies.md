Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
