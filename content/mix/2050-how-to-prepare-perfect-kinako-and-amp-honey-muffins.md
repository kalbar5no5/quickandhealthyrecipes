Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
