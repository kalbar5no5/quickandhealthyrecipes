Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
