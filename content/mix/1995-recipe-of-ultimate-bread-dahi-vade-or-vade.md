Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
