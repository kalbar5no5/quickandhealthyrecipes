- "1 Hard boiled eggs chilled"
- "1 Mayonnaise"
- "1 Mustard"
- "1 Horseradish"
- "1 salt  pepper to taste"
- "1 garlic powder to taste"
- "1 minced chives"
recipeinstructions:
- "Peel the eggs and cut them in half long ways."
- "Pop the yolks out into a small mixing bowl and smash them up with a fork.  Stir in a bit of salt, pepper and garlic pepper.  Just a little; you can add more later."
- "Squirt in some mustard and stir to distribute."
- "Add some horseradish and stir.  Again, go easy.  You can add more, if necessary, after the next step."
- "Now add the mayonnaise and stir well to combine all the ingredients.  Unfortunately, in case you&#39;re looking at the photos for approximate amounts to use, I didn&#39;t follow my own advice, and I put in too much mayo.  The mixture was too loose when I stirred it up.  (It was late, I was tired.). So I had to boil more eggs and add those yolks to the mix.  Don&#39;t repeat my mistake.  It&#39;s a drag."
- "Taste for seasoning.  Add more seasoning and/or horseradish, a little at a time, to your own preference."
- "Spoon or pipe the filling into the egg whites and sprinkle with minced chives.  I also like to top them with black olive halves, but I had none on hand.  Store in a covered container in the refrigerator."

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
