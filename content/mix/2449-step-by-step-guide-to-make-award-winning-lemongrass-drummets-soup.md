Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
