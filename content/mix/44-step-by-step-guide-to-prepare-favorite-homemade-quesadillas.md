Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
