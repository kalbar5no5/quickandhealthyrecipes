Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
