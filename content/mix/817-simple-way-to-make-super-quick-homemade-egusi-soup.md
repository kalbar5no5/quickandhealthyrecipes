Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!
