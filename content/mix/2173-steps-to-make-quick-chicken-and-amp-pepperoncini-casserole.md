Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
