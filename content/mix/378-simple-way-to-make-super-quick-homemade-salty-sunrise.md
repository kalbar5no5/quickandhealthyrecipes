Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
