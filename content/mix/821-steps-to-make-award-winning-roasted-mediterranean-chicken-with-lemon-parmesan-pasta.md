Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
