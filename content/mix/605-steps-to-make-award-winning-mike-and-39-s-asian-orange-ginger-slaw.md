Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood.

The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s.

It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest.
