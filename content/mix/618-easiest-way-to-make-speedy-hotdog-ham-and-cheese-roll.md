Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
