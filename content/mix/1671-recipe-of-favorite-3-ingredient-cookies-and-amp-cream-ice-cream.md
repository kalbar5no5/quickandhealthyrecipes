They are light, fluffy and thick, rich cookie that has the perfect peanut butter balance. Once they are cooked golden brown in oven enjoy warm with a cold glass of milk. Made with peanut butter and oatmeal, it can be made with or without the banana and is the perfect quick and easy breakfast! I REALLY love using a European style butter in this recipe, as the fat content is slightly higher, meaning it will be that much more rich and flavorful. These unbelievably easy -- and gluten-free -- cookies have only three ingredients and are a great way to use up those extra mixed nuts hanging out in. 

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
