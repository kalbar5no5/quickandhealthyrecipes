Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body.
