Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
