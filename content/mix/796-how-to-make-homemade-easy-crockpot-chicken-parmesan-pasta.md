Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
