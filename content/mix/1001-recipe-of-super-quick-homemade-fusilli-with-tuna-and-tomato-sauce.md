Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
