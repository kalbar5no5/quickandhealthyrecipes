Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
