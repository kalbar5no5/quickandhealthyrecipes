How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
