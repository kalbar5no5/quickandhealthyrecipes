Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
