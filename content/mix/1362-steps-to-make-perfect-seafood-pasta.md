The shrimp/prawns should take no more than a minute per side (depending on size) and the calamari and mussels will take only a few minutes to cook. The busiati pasta is not a very popular shape here in the US, but it is traditionally served with seafood in Italy. If you can&#39;t find this shape of pasta, no problem, just use another, like linguine, spaghetti or a shorter pasta. Add the tomatoes, cream, pepper flakes and salt and pepper, to taste. Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a large pot of salted, boiling water over medium heat, according to package directions. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
