Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
