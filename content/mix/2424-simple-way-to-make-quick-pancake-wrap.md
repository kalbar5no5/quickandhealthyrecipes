Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
