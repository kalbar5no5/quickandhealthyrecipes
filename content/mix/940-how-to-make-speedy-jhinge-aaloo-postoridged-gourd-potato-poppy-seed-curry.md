Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
