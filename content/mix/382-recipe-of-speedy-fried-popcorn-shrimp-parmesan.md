Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
