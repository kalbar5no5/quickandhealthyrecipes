Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body.
