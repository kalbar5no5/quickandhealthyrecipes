Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
