Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!
