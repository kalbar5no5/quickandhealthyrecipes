Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
