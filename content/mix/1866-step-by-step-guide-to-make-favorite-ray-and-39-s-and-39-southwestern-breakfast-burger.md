Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
