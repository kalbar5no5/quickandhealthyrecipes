If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better.
