Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
