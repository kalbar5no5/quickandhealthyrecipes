Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
