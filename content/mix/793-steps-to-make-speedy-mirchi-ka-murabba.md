Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
