How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
