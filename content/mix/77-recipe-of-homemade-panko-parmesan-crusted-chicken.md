Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
