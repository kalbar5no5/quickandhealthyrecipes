Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
