Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
