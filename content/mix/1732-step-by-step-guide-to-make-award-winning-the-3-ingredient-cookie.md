How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
