Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
