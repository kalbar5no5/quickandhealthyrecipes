Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
