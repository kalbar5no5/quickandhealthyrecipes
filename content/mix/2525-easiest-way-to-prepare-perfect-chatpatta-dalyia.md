Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
