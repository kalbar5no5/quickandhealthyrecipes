Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
