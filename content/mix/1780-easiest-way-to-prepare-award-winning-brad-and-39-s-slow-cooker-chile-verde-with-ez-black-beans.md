Soaking dried beans can make them mushy and bland. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
