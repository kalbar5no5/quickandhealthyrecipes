Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
