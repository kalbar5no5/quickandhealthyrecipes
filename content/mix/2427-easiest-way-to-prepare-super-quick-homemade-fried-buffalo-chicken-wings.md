Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
