How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
