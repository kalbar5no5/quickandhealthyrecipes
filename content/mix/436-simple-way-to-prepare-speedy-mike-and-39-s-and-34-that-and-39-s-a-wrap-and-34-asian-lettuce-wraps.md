Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
