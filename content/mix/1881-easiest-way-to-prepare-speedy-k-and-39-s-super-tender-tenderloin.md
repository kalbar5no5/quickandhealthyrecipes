Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
