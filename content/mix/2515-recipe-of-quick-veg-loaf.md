Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
