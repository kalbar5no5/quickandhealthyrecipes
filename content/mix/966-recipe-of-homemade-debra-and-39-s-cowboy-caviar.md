Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
