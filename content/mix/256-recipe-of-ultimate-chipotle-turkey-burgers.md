Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
