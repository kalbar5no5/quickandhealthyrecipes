recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350 Degrees(F)."
- "Prepare 2 boxes of Stove Top Stuffing for Turkey.  Set Aside."
- "Mix all Meatball Ingredients together gently with hands.  Roll into small meatballs.  Use about 1 Tbsp. of meat mixture for each one.  Place meatballs onto parchment lined cookie sheet.  Bake for about 15-20 minutes until done."
- "Put approximately 2 tsp. of Stuffing into the palm of your hand and flatten it out.   Place a meatball into the center of the stuffing and wrap the stuffing around the meatball.    Once there’s stuffing around the meatball, roll it as when you made the meatballs.    This will allow a thin coating of the stuffing to cover the entire surface of the meatball.  You don’t want the stuffing too thick around the outside."
- "As you roll out each ball, place them in a pan/bowl with the other 1 cup of Bread Crumbs.    Roll each ball to lightly coat in bread crumbs.                     Repeat with all of the meatballs."
- "Helpful Hint:  It helps to refrigerate the balls for at least an hour before frying, but it’s not completely necessary."
- "Fry the balls lightly in ¼ Cup Vegetable Oil.  Remove each as done and drain on towel lined plate."
- "Cranberry Glaze Instructions:  Place all ingredients in medium saucepan and bring to a simmer for about 10 minutes.    Stir until smooth.  Spoon on top of meatballs for serving."
- "Placing each ball into a small paper cupcake liner adds to the presentation and ease of serving."

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
