Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
