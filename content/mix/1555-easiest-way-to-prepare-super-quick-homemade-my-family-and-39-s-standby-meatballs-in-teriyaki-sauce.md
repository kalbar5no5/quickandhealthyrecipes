Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
