Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
