Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
