Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood.

These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving!
