One of our goals this summer is to eat out less. We spend so much money on food and it&#39;s not because we like to eat out.

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
