Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
