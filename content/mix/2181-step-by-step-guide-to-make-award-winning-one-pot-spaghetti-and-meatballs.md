Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
