Place the lid on the rice cooker and turn it on. Frozen dumplings take a bit longer to heat through completely. The Japanese version of steamed dumpling, shumai (シュウマイor 焼売), also called shao mai, is quite easy to make. See the video below the recipe to believe it. It tastes like the ones you get at restaurants and is certainly much better than the frozen shumai you can buy at Asian grocery stores. 

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
