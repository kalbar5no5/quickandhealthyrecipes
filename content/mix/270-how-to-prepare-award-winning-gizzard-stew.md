Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
