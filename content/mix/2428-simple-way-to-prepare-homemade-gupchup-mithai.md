Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
