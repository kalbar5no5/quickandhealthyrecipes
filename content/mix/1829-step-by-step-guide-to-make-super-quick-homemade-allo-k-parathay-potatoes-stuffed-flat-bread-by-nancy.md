Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
