Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
