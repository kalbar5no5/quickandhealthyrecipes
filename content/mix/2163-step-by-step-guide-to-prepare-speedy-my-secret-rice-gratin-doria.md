Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
