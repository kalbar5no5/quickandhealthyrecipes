Pani Puri is the most loving Street snack amongst the population of India which is availble easily. Pani puri, phoolki, puchka or golgappa, is a popular and beloved chaat recipe from India. Because of the hygiene and cleanliness issue, many people prefer making pani puri at home from scratch. The pani puri water is what binds all the components together and makes the filling-filled puris such a fun experience! I make my version of jaljeera with a host of spices and seasonings that boost the flavour of the pani. 

Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
