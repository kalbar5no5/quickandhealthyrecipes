Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
