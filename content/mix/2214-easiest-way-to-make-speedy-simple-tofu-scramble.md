Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
