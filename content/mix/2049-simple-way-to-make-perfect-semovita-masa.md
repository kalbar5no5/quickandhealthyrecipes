Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
