Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
