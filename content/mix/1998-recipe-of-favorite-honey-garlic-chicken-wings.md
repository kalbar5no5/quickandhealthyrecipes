Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
