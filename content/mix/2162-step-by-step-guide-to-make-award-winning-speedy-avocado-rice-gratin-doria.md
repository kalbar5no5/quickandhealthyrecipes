Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
