Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
