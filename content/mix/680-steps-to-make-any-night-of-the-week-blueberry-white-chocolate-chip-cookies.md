Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
