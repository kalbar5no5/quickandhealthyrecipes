Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
