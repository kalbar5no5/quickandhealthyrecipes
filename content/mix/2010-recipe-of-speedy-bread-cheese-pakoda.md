Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
