Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
