Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
