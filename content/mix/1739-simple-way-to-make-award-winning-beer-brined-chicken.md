Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
