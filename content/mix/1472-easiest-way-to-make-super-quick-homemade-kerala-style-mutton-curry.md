Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
