Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
