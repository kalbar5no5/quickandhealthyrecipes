Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
