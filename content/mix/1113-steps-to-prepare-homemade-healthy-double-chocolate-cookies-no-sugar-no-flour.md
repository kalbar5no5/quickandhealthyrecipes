Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
