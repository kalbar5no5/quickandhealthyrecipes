Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
