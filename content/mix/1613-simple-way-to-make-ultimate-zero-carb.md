Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
