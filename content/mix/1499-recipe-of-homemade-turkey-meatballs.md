recipeinstructions:
- "Sazon. Okay so I am Caribbean and we cook with fresh ingredients. We make sazon (some call it mojo) with red bell peppers, green bell peppers, yellow bell peppers, onion, garlic, sweet peppers (this is called gustoso in spanish markets), dried oregano and water. Put all ingredients in the blender This liquified seasoning is amazing on all of your meats. Once done set aside. First picture shows the sazon after it&#39;s been done."
- "Place ground turkey in a bowl. Add the sazon, panko bread. 1/2 tbsp of dried basil, dried oregano. 1 tbsp of chicken seasoning. Add 1/2 tsp salt and pepper. Mix well adding more bread if meat mixture is too wet. You want meat that feels dense but still soft."
- "After well combined, shape into balls. I use my hands as a guide for how big I want them, but you can use an ice cream scoop if you want uniform shaped ones. Place in the fridge for half hour to let them firm up and also the flavors to mix well into the meat."
- "Fried the meat balls in a pan with enough oil. Making sure they don&#39;t burn and you turn them on all sides. If you have a deep fryer this works best (I need to invest in one but I&#39;m not a fan of frying that much ðŸ¤£)"
- "This is how they look after fried. These are popular with kids too. Also, we dont really eat them like this, we then cook them in sauce and serve ontop of rice. What I did was place them in my slow cooker after I fried them and added my own sauce and let them slow cook for half hour. They are super delicious and moist. I hope you enjoy."

Hey everyone, it is me, Dave, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, turkey meatballs. One of my favorites. This time, I'm gonna make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Lean turkey meatballs are great stashed in the freezer, so double the recipe. Portion out the meatballs onto a large parchment-lined baking pan and freeze them until firm. Remove from freezer and thaw in refrigerator before baking. Although it&#39;s a lean meat, ground turkey is perfect for making delicious meatballs.

Turkey Meatballs is one of the most favored of recent trending foods in the world. It's appreciated by millions every day. It is simple, it's quick, it tastes delicious. Turkey Meatballs is something which I've loved my entire life. They are fine and they look wonderful.


To begin with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few components. You can cook turkey meatballs using 14 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

1. Take  Ground Turkey
1. Make ready  Garlic Powder
1. Prepare  Dried Oregano
1. Make ready  Dried basil
1. Make ready  Veganless chicken seasoning (or regular powder chicken bullions)

Spray a nonstick pan lightly with veggie oil. While meatball purists might declare blasphemy, turkey meatballs are actually my favorite meatballs. It&#39;s partially nostalgia â€” the only kind of meatballs my dad made growing up were made with turkey â€” and partially because I enjoy their lighter flavor and texture. For the meatballs: In a large bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, basil, parsley, milk, ketchup if using, tomato paste, salt, pepper, eggs, garlic and onions.

##### Steps to make Turkey Meatballs:

1. Sazon. Okay so I am Caribbean and we cook with fresh ingredients. We make sazon (some call it mojo) with red bell peppers, green bell peppers, yellow bell peppers, onion, garlic, sweet peppers (this is called gustoso in spanish markets), dried oregano and water. Put all ingredients in the blender This liquified seasoning is amazing on all of your meats. Once done set aside. First picture shows the sazon after it&#39;s been done.
1. Place ground turkey in a bowl. Add the sazon, panko bread. 1/2 tbsp of dried basil, dried oregano. 1 tbsp of chicken seasoning. Add 1/2 tsp salt and pepper. Mix well adding more bread if meat mixture is too wet. You want meat that feels dense but still soft.
1. After well combined, shape into balls. I use my hands as a guide for how big I want them, but you can use an ice cream scoop if you want uniform shaped ones. Place in the fridge for half hour to let them firm up and also the flavors to mix well into the meat.
1. Fried the meat balls in a pan with enough oil. Making sure they don&#39;t burn and you turn them on all sides. If you have a deep fryer this works best (I need to invest in one but I&#39;m not a fan of frying that much ðŸ¤£)
1. This is how they look after fried. These are popular with kids too. Also, we dont really eat them like this, we then cook them in sauce and serve ontop of rice.

It&#39;s partially nostalgia â€” the only kind of meatballs my dad made growing up were made with turkey â€” and partially because I enjoy their lighter flavor and texture. For the meatballs: In a large bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, basil, parsley, milk, ketchup if using, tomato paste, salt, pepper, eggs, garlic and onions. Using a wooden spoon, stir to. Tender meatballs filled with onions and Parmesan, bathed in plenty of tomato sauce, are classics in every way except for one: They call for turkey instead of the usual beef (or beef-veal-pork. Get a nice big bowl out, roll up your sleeves, and let&#39;s get started! 

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
