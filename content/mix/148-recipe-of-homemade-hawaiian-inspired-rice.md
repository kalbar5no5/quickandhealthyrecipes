Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
