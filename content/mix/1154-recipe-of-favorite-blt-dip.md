Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
