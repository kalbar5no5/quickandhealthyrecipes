Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
