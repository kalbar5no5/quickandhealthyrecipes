How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
