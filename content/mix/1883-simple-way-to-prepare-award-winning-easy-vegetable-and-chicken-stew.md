Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
