Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
