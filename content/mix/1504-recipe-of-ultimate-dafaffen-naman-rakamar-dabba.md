Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
