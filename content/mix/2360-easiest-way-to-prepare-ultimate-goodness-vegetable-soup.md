Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
