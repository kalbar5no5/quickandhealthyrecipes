Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
