Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
