How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
