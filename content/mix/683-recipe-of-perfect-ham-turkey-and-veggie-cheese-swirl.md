Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
