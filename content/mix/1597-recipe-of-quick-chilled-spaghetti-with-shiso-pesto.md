Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
