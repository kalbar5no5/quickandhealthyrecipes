Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
