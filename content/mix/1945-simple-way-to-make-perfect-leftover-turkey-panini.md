Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
