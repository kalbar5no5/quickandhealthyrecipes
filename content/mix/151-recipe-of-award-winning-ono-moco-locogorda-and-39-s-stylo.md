recipeingredient:
- " For the patties"
- "1 lb Ground beef"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "1/4 tsp black pepper or to taste"
- "1/4 cup diced onions I use Maui brown or white onions"
- " For the mushroom gravy"
- "2 tbsp butter"
- "8 oz sliced button mushrooms"
- "13 1/2 oz beef stock"
- "1 tsp Worcestershire sauce"
- "1 dash salt"
- "1 dash black pepper"
- "1 tbsp cornstarch"
- "1 tbsp water"
- "1 pinch scallions for garnish"
- "4 eggs optional  cooked sunny side up"
recipeinstructions:
- "Season beef with salt &amp; pepper &amp; lightly mix.  Add diced onions &amp; mix again. For this step I like to mix by hand using food handling disposable gloves."
- "Divide the meat in four equal parts and form each portion of meat into an oval or round shape patting it down slightly. Set patties to the side and heat up skillet. Once you got your pan HOT, add all four patties and cook for about four minutes lowering heat a bit as not to burn meat. Flip over &amp; cook till desired doneness..like cooking hamburgers, if you like it rare then don&#39;t cook too long( about 3-4minutes per side.) Cook longer for well done. If you choose to eat the loco moco with egg, cook each egg sunny side up in one tbs butter."
- "For the gravy:Melt 2 TBS butter in a pan &amp; sautee the mushrooms for aprox 5 minutes. Add the beef broth, dash of salt &amp; black pepper &amp; about a teaspoon of Worcheschire sauce. Bring to a hard boil, meanwhile take the 1 tbs of cornstarch &amp; put it in a small cup or bowl add 1 tbs of water to make a paste &amp; add to boiling broth. The cornstarch slurry will thicken the broth making a slightly thick brown mushroom gravy. At this point you can decide if you want a thicker gravy which you can achieve by adding another tbs of cornstarch mixed with water again &amp; adding it in. Add more salt &amp; pepper if needed to taste."
- "Traditionally, loco moco is served with a sunny side egg atop the meat patty &amp; gravy. Some prefer with the egg &amp; some without (I show both versions) but definitely serve with steamed white rice! ;)"
- "The way this is assembled is scoop up some rice &amp; put on plate. Place meat patty on top of rice &amp; ladle some mushroom gravy all over &amp; top with a sunny side egg. Garnish with scallions. **This dish originated in my birth state of Hawaii where it is originally called LOCO MOCO. But this is my version with a lil swith up to the name because it&#39;s MY interpretation of this simple favorite Island &#34;local grind&#34;. Enjoy!"

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
