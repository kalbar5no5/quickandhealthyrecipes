Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
