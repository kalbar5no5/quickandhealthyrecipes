Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
