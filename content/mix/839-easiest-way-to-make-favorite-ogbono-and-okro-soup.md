Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
