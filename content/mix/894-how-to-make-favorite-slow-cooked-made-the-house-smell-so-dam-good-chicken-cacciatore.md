Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
