Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
