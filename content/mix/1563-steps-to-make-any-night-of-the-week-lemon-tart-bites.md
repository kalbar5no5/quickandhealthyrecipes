How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
