Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
