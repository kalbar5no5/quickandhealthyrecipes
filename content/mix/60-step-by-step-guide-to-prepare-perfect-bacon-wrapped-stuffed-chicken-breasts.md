Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood.

The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine.
