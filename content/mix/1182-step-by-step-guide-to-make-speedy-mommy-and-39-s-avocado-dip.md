Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
