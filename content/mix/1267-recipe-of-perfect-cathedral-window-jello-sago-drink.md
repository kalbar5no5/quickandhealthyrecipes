Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
