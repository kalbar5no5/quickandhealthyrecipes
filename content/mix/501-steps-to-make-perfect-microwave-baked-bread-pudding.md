How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
