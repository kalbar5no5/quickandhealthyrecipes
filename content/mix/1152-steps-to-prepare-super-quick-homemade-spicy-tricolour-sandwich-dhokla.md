Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
