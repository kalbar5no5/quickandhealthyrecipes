Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
