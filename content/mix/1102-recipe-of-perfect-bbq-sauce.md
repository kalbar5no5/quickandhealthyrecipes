Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
