Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
