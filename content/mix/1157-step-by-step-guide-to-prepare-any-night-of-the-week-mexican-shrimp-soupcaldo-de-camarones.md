Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
