Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
