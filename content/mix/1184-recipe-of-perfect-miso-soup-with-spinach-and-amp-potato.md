Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
