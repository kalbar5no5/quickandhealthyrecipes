Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
