Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
