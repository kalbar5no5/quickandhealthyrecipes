Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
