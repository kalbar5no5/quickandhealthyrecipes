How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
