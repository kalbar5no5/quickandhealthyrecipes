How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
