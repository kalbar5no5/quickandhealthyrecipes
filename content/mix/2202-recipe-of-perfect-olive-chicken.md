Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
