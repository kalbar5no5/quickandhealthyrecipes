Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
