Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
