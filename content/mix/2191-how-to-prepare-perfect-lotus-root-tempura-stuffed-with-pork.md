Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
