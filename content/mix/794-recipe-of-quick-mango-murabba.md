Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
