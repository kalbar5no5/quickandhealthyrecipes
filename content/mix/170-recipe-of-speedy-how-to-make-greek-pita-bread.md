recipeingredient:
- "6 g Active Instant Dry Yeast"
- "4 g Granulated Sugar"
- "160 ml Whole Milk Room Temperature"
- "80 ml Water"
- "320 g Unbleached Allpurpose Flour"
- "6 g Sea Salt"
- "1 TSP Zaatar"
- " Greek Olive Oil 14g  More For Greasing"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a bowl, combine yeast, sugar, milk and water.   Stir to dissolve the yeast and sugar. Stir, stir, stir.   Set aside for 10 minutes or until becomes foamy.   In a large bowl, add flour, salt and za&#39;atar.   Mix to combine well. Mix, mix, mix."
- "Add olive oil into the yeast mixture.   Stir to combine well.   Add the yeast mixture into the flour mixture.   Combine the mixture well until it becomes a dough. You can do this by hand or a spatula.   Once it becomes a dough, knead the dough inside the bowl until all the nooks and crannies of flour is kneaded into the dough, about 8 to 10 minutes."
- "The dough should be soft, subtle and tacky, but not sticky. It should pass the &#34;window-pane&#34; test.   If the dough is too dry, add in water, 1 TBSP at a time. If the dough is too sticky, add in flour, 1 TBSP at a time.   Form the dough into a ball.   Lightly grease the dough ball with olive oil.   Transfer back into the bowl."
- "Cover with cling film and set aside in a warm place for 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size.   Lightly grease working surface with olive oil.   Transfer the dough onto a working surface.   Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces with a weight scale.   Form each piece into a dough ball."
- "While working with 1 dough ball, cover the rest of the dough ball with a damp lint-free kitchen towel.   Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out into a round disc with a diameter of 8 inches.   Heat a skillet over medium-high heat.   Place the shaped dough into the skillet."
- "Air pockets will start to form.   Once the bottom is lightly charred, flip and cook the other side until lightly charred.   Remove from heat and set aside until ready to use.   Repeat the steps for the remaining dough balls.   You can serve pita with gyros, souvlaki and even hummus. Or you can use them as a wrap or as a sandwich."

Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
