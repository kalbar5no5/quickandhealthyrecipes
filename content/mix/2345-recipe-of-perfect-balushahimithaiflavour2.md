Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
