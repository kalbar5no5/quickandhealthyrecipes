Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
