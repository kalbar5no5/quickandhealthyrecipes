Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
