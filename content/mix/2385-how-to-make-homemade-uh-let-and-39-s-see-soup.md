Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
