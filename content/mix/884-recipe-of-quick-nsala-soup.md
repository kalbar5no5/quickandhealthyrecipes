Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
