Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
