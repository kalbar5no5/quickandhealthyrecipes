How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
