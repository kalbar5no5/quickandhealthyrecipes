Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
