Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
