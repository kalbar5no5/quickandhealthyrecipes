Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
