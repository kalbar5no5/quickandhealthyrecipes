Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
