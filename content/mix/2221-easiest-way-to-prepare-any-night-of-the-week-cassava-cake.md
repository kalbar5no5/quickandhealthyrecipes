Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
