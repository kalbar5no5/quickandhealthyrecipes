Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
