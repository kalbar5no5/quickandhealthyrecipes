How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
