Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at battling depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
