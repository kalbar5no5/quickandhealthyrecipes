If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk.

Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine.
