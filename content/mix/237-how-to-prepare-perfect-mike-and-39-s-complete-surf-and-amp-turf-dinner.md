Wanted to take my two college-aged daughters surfing as one of our big activities for the trip, but had some difficulty booking through the resort and thought it just wasn&#39;t meant to be. Fortunately, we received a recommendation for Mike&#39;s Surf School from the manager at Seven. We provide each participant with the surf/sup board a leash and a rash guard. We are a licensed, insured and permitted surf school on the north shore of Oahu.

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
