recipeingredient:
- "500 to 600 grams Beef tendon"
- "1/2 Daikon radish"
- "4 Eggs"
- "1 Konnyaku"
- "1 as much to taste Chikuwa and other oden ingredients"
- "10 to 12 Bamboo skewers for the been tendondont forget these"
- " For the oden soup storebought is fine"
- "1000 ml Water or bonito dashi stock"
- "1 10cm long piece Kombu"
- "80 ml Sake"
- "80 ml Soy sauce"
- "1 tbsp Sugar"
- "1 1/2 tbsp Bonito dashi stock granules if using water rather than dashi"
- "1/2 to 1 teaspoon Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Slice the daikon into the thickness you like, and parboil it. Boil the konnyaku also. Hard boil the eggs and peel."
- "Cut the beef tendon into bite sized pieces using a knife or kitchen shears. Using the shears is easier."
- "Bring plenty of water to a boil in a frying pan, and throw in the beef tendon. Bring to a boil over high heat."
- "A lot of scum will rise to the surface, but just ignore it and simmer over medium heat for 7 to 8 minutes. If the scum bothers you, remove it."
- "Bring the frying pan over to the sink, throw out the hot liquid, pour some lukewarm water over the meat and drain. Don&#39;t burn yourself."
- "When the water in the frying pan is lukewarm, wash the beef tendon by massaging it. Change the water twice, and keep washing the meat until the water runs clear."
- "When it&#39;s washed, spread the meat out on paper towels and pat dry. The beef tendon becomes shiny and clean as shown in the photo."
- "Skewer the beef tendon. And here you have meaty, hearty beef tendon pieces!"
- "I was able to make 10 beef tendon skewers. You can freeze them like this. If you prep a lot of beef tendon in one go it&#39;s very convenient. You can take the skewers out and use the meat in curry and so on."
- "Put the water and seasoning ingredients (bonito dashi stock granules, or storebought oden soup base) in a pan, add the konbu seaweed and simmer to make the dashi or soup base. You can use the konbu seaweed in the oden (re-added later and simmered until tender)."
- "When the soup is boiling, add the beef tendon, and simmer over low heat for 1 hour. Don&#39;t let it boil too hard, or the dashi will become cloudy and not as tasty."
- "Add the parboiled daikon radish, konnyaku, and eggs from step 1, and simmer for another hour or so."
- "As you continue simmering, clear fat from the beef tendon will rise to the surface, so skim it off diligently. This makes the soup stock really delicious."
- "After 2 hours of simmering, the beef tendon will become tender enough that a skewer goes through it easily. The soup stock will be deliciously flavored with the beef tendon too."
- "I always let it rest overnight so that the daikon radish, eggs and meat become permeated with flavor. The next day the fat will have floated to the surface and hardened, so just scoop this out."
- "Heat it up the next day, add more dashi stock and fish paste cakes (such as chikuwa and gobo-maki) of your choice, simmer some more and it&#39;s done!"
- "The meaty beef tendon and the daikon radish which have soaked up the beef soup overnight are just sublime! Mustard and yuzu pepper go well with this."
- "It&#39;s still delicious if you don&#39;t rest it overnight, but in that case make sure to remove any fat from the surface in step 13. The soup will become clean and delicious."
- "Gobo-maki (fish paste sticks with burdock root) and chikuwa fish sticks go very well in this oden. Mochi-kinchaku (mochi rice cake in a fried tofu bag) is delicious too, as it soaks up the beef soup. My favorite is chikuwa."

Curry with lots of chunky vegetables is good, but curry with the vegetables melted into the roux is really tasty too! The key is to properly parboil the beef tendon with ginger to remove any gaminess. 

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
