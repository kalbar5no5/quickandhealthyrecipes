Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
