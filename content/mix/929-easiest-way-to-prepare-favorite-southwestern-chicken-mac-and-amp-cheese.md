How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
