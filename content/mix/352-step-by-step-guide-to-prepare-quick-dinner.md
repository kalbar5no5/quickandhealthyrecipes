Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
