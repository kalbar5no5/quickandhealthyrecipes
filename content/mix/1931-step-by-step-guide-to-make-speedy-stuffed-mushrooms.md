Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
