Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
