Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
