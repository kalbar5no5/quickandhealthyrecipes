recipeingredient:
- " Bread Dough"
- "1 3/4 cup allpurpose flour"
- "1 tbsp nonfat dried milk powerder"
- "1 tsp instant yeast"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "1/3 cup cold water"
- "1 large egg"
- "1 tbsp granulated sugar"
- "2 tbsp unsalted butter room temp"
- " Cookie Dough"
- "1 1/3 cup allpurpose flour"
- "3/4 tbsp baking powder"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "5 tbsp unsalted butter room temp"
- "1/3 cup sugar"
- "1 large egg"
- "1/4 tsp vanilla extract"
recipeinstructions:
- "To make the bread dough, whisk together the flour, powdered milk, yeast and salt.  Beat the egg and cold water together until well blended.  Add to the flour mixture in the bowl."
- "Using the dough hook, mix at low speed until a rough dough forms.  Increase the speed and mix at medium speed for about 4 minutes.  The dough should have a rather stiff consistency."
- "Decrease the speed to low and slowly add the sugar.  Mix until the sugar is fully incorporated.  The dough should soften a little at this point.  Increase the speed to medium and knead for about 10 minutes, or until the dough becomes supple and elastic."
- "Again decrease the speed to low and add the softened butter.  Knead until mixed in, 2-3 minutes.  Increase the speed to medium and contine kneading for about 5-6 min"
- "Transfer the dough to a lightly-oiled bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap.  Let sit at room temp until doubled, about 1 hour."
- "Lightly grease a large baking sheet or line with parchment paper.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently deflate.  Divide the dough evenly into 8 pieces.  Keeping the unused pieces covered, round each piece into a ball.  Transfer onto prepared baking sheet.  Cover the dough loosely with lightly oiled plastic wrap and let sit at room temp until doubled, about 1 hour."
- "While waiting on the bread dough, start the cookie dough.  Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt; set aside.  In the bowl of the mixer, use paddle attachment, cream together the butter and sugar at medium-high speed until fluffy for about 2 minutes.  Scrape side of bowl as needed.  Add egg and vanilla and beat until combined."
- "Add the flour mixture to the butter and sugar mixture, mixing at low speed just until combined.  Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate while waiting for the bread dough to finish rising."
- "Preheat overn to 350°F"
- "Unwrap the cookie dough and divide it into 8 even pieces.  Roll each into a ball, keeping unused pieces covered.  Using as little flour as possible, roll each ball into a flat roud, about 3 1/2 inches in diameter."
- "With a sharp paring knife score each round with a crosshatch pattern.  Drape each piece of cookie dough over the risen bread dough, being careful not to deflate them. The cookie dough should encase the top and side."
- "Bake at 350°F for 20-25 minute or until barely golden on top.  Tranfer to wire and cool."

Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
