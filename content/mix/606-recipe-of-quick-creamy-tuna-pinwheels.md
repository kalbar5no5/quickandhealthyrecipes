Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
