Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
