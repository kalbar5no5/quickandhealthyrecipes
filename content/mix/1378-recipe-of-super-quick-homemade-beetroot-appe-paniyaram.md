Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
