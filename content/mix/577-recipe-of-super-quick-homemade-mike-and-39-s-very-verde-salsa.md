Add another 1/4 tsp at a time until you&#39;re satisfied with the acidity.                                                                                                                                                       ° Definitely add 1/3 cup of your favorite green purchased salsa! And, it&#39;s not cheating! It has preservatives that will tame the acid considerably. Add it last as your salsa cools down. Pedros is a great brand! Spicy but delicious!"
- "Serve hot or chilled with guacamole and sour cream to tame the heat. Also, with tortilla chips, tacos or burritos. Enjoy!"

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
