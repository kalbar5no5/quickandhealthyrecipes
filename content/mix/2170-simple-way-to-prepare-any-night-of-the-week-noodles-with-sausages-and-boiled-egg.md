If you need to make a meal with carbohydrates and protein and can&#39;t run to a tuna sandwich, scrambled eggs on toast or anything conventional, you can cook. Sometimes it helps to break them up a little; it makes serving the ramen a little easier. Crack an egg into the boiling soup/water and then using a utensil, beat the egg up so it mixes slightly with the noodles - don&#39;t mix it too well, just enough to break the yolk and mix. Eggs are good for the nervous system and physical development, and the rich lecithin from their yolk also contributes to improving our memory. When the water boils, add in some hand-made noodles and stir slowly but well with chopsticks. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
