Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
