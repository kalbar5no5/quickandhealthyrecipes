Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
