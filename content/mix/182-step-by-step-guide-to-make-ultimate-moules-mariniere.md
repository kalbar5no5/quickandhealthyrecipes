Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
