Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better.

This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.
