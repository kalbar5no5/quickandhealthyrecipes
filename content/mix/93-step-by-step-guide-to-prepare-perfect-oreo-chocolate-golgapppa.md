Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
