Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
