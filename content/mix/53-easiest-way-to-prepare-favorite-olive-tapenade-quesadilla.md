recipeingredient:
- "1 handful stoned green olives"
- "1 handful stoned black olives"
- "1 handful walnuts"
- "1 tablespoon capers"
- "3 tablespoons grated Parmesan"
- "2 sprigs fresh rosemary"
- "1 good glug of extra virgin olive oil"
- "4 soft tortillas"
- "70-100 g tuna mayonnaise optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the olives, capers, walnuts, Parmesan and rosemary in a pestle and mortar, add a good glug of oil and grind to a rustic consistency. Only use the tips of the rosemary not the stalks. Use more olive oil if required so that it&#39;s not too dry. Add a good grind of black pepper to taste."
- "Lay out two tortillas on a chopping board and spoon the mixture on, spread even across and near to the edges. Add the tuna mayo on top if you feel like it and spread evenly. Lay another tortilla on top of each to make a &#34;sandwich&#34;."
- "In a medium hot frying pan add the tiniest drop of olive oil, put the quesadilla and work it around. I&#39;ll try with a dry pan next time as I&#39;m sure that will work too."
- "Cook for a minute or so each side and keep turning so it takes on a nice colour but doesn&#39;t burn. When you&#39;re happy with the colour both sides remove, cut into quarters and serve."
- "Let the good times roll!"

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
