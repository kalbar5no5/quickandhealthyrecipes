Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
