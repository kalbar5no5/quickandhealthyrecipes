Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
