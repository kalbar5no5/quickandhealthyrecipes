Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
