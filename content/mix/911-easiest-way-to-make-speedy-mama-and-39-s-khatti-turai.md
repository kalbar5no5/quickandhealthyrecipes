Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
