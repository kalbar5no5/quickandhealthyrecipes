Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
