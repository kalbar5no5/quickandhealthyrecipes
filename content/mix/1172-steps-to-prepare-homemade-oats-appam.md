Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
