Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
