Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
