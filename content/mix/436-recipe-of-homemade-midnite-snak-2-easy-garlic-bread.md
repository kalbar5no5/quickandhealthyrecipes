Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
