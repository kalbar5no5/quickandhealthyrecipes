Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
