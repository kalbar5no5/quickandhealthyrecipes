Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
