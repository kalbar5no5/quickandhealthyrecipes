Kraft Mayo Comes In a Variety of Flavors to Take Your Midday Sandwich to the Next Level! Great recipe for Mentaiko-Filled Chikuwa Isobe-age (Nori Seaweed Flavored Fritters).

The cod roe sauce can be used as a dip for fried or grilled foods. This time, I enjoyed the grilled fish dipping in the Mentaiko Mayo sauce.

The cod roe sauce can be used as a dip for fried or grilled foods. This time, I enjoyed the grilled fish dipping in the Mentaiko Mayo sauce. Since Mentaiko Mayonnaise tends to go especially well with plain foods, it makes a good pair with fresh vegetables and seaweed salads. Combine mentaiko roe with mayonnaise in a small bowl; stir to combine. Place scallops on a foil-lined oven tray. 

Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
