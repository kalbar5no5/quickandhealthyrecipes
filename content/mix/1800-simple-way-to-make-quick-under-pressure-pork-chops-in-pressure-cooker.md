Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
