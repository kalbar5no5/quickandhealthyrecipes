Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
