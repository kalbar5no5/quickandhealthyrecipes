Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
