Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
