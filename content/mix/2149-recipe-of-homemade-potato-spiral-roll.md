Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk.

These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body.
