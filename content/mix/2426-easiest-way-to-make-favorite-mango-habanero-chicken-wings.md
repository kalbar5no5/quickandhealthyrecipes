How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
