Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
