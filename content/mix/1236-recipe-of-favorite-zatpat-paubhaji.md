Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
