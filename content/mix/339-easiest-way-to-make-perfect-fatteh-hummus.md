Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
