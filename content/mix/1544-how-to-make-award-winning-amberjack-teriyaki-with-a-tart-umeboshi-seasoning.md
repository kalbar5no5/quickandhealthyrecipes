Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
