Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
