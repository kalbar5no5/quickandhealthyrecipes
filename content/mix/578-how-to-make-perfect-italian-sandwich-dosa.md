Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
