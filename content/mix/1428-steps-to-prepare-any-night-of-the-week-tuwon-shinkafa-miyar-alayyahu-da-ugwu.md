Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
