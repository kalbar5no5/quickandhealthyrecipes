Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
