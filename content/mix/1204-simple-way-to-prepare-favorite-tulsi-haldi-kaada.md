Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
