Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
