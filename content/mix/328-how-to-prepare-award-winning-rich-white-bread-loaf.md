Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
