Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
