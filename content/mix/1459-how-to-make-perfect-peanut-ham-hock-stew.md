Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
