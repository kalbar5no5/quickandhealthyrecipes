Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
