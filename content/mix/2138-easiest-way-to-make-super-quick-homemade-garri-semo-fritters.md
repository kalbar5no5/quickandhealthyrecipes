Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
