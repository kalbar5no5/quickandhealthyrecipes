Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
