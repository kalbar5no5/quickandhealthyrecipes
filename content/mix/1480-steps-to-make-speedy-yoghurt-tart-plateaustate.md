Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
