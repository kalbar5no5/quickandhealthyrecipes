Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
