Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
