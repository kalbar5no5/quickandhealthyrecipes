Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
