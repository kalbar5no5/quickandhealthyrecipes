Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
