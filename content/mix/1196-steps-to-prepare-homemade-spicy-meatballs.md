- "Start by adding your crushed saltines and a splash of milk and mix to make a loose paste. Add the rest of your ingredients to the mixing bowl except for the crushed red pepper and mix well. I cook one meatball to test the heat and salt content. I noticed mine were not very spicy so I added 2 tbsp of crushed red pepper."
- "To cook the meatballs I use a bit of a non traditional method. I will add a can of tomato sauce and a can of water with a few pinches of salt to a small pot. In batches I will roll the meatballs and add them for about 5 to 7 minutes or until slightly firm and cooked through and then set aside on a foil lined baking sheet. This way your meatballs will retain their round shape."
- "If your making a traditional pasta sauce you can add them to the sauce and just allow them to cook until service. If not doing a traditional sauce that they can steep in I allow them to cool in the fridge and when ready for service I add some evo to a large pan and sear them to get really nice color."

How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
