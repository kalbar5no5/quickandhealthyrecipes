Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
