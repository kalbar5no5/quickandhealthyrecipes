Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
