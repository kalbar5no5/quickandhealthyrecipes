Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body.
