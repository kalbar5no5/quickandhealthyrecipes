Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
