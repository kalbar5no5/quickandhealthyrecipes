Now featuring Scott Patterson Gift Boxes featuring coffee and more products coming soon. Real tacos are made with corn or flour tortillas (homemade being preferable) filled with the most amazing ingredients ― think fried avocados, chipotle-rubbed salmon or pulled pork ― and topped with complementary accents like spicy salsas and fresh herbs. If you&#39;re not convinced yet, make one of the recipes below and you&#39;ll see what we&#39;re talking about. Tacos rival burgers for sheer fun packaging. Corn and flour tortillas are very different characters: A fresh corn tortilla is full of heady masa aroma and a pleasantly springy texture, while the best flour tortillas are soft but chewy. 

Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
