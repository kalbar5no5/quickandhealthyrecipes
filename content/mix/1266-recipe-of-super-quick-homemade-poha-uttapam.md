How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
