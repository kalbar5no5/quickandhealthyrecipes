Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
