Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
