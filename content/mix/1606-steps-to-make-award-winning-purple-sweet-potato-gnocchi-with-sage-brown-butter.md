recipeingredient:
- "2 pounds purple sweet potatoes about 34 medium potatoes"
- "2 eggs"
- "1 teaspoon dried sage"
- "1/2 teaspoon nutmeg"
- "1 teaspoon salt"
- "1 1/2 cup flour plus extra for dusting"
- "3 tablespoons butter"
- "4 tablespoons fresh sage chopped"
- "2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350 and roast sweet potatoes until tender. About 30-40 min."
- "Remove skin from potatoes and mash insides with a fork or potato masher. Once mashed, you must allow the potatoes to completely cook. You can put the potatoes in the refrigerator or freezer to speed the cooling process."
- "Pour the flour onto a clean dry countertop and shape it into a ring."
- "Crack eggs into the center of the ring and beat with a fork. Do not mix any of the flour into the egg mixture as this time. Add the dried sage, nutmeg, and salt to the eggs."
- "Add the mashed sweet potatoes to the egg mixture and combine."
- "Using your hands, slowly start to mix the flour into the potato mixture. Gently Knead the dough until well combined and no longer sticky. If the dough is too sticky, add more flour."
- "Dust flour on the countertop, roll dough into large ball, and cut ball into four pieces."
- "Roll each quarter into long strands approximately 1 inch in diameter."
- "Cut gnocchi into 1 inch cubes and separate on baking sheet. Do not allow gnocchi to touch as they will likely stick together."
- "At this point you can either put baking tray in freezer to freeze gnocchi for later use, or boil water for immediate use."
- "Add gnocchi to boiled salted water and cook until they rise to the top. About 2-3 minutes."
- "Drain pot and reserve about a 1/4 cup of the pasta water."
- "Add butter to a large saucepan and melt. Once butter starts to foam, add fresh sage and fry until crispy. When butter starts to brown (make sure it doesn’t burn) add the pasta water and stir. The pasta water should thicken the butter and make the sauce creamier."
- "Add gnocchi to pan and stir to coat with butter sauce. Once combined, remove gnocchi from pan and top with grated Parmesan cheese. Enjoy!"

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
