Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
