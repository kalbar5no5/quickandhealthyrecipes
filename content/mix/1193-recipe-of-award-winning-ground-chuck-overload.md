Remove cooked sausage and chuck with a slotted spoon and transfer to the simmering tomato puree. Ground beef is a freezer staple, especially if you&#39;re following a low-carbohydrate diet such as Atkins or Paleo -- or you have a big family. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Our standards prohibit calves being kept in individual stalls or crates, so they have social interactions with other animals. 

Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
