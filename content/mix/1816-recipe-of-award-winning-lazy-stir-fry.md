Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
