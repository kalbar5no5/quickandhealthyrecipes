Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
