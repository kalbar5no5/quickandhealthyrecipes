Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
