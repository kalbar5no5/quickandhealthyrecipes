Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
