Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
