Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
