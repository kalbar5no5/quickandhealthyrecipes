Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
