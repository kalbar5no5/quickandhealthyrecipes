Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
