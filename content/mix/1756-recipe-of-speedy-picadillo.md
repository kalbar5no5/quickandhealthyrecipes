Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
