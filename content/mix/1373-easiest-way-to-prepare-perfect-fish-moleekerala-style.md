Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
