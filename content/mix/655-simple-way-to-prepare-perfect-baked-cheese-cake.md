Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
