Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!
