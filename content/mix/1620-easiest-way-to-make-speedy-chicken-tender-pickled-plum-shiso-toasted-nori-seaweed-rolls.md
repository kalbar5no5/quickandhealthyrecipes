recipeingredient:
- "6 Chicken tenders"
- "2 tbsp Umeboshi paste"
- "6 Shiso leaves"
- "3 sheets Toasted nori seaweed"
- "1/2 tbsp Vegetable oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Remove the skin and sinews from the chicken tenders, open them up, and lightly stroke with the back of a knife to stretch it out and even out the thickness."
- "Spread out kneaded pickled plum onto step 1, place the shiso leaves on top, and roll up from the side. The shiso leaves were small, so I used two for the one shown in the photo."
- "This is what they should look like. Don&#39;t worry about the meat ripping in step 1 since they&#39;ll get wrapped up in nori seaweed. Just roll them up."
- "Cut the nori seaweed to the size of the chicken tenders, and roll up step 3. I rolled these up in a cut  half sheet of nori seaweed."
- "Place the overlap facing downwards, and let sit for a while so that the nori seaweed closes up. The nori seaweed will shrink when toasted, so there is no need to wrap them tightly."
- "Heat up oil in a frying pan, line up the rolls with the overlaps facing downwards, cover with a lid, and fry. Cook all the way through."
- "Cut into bite-sized pieces and serve into plates. This is rather tasty with just the flavor of the kneaded pickled plum, but it is also tasty with grated ponzu sauce as well."

Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
