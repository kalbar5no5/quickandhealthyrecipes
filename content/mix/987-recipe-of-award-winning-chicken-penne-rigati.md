Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
