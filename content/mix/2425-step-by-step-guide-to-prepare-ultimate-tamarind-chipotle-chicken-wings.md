- "12 Chicken wings"
- "8 oz Tamarind fruit"
- "4 Chipotle peppers"
- "1/4 tsp ground cumin"
- "1/2 tsp cayenne pepper"
- "1/4 tsp Onion powder"
- "1/2 tsp garlic powder"
- "1 tsp Knorr chicken flavor bouillon"
- "2 tbsp clover honey"
- "2 tbsp brown sugar"
- "1 1/2 tbsp salt"
- "1/4 tsp ground cinnamon"
- "2 cup boiling water"
recipeinstructions:
- "If necessary, wash and/or thaw chicken wings. Season with Goya all-purpose seasoning or just salt and pepper. Set aside."
- "Now for the fun part, getting the pulp from the tamarind fruit. Begin with 2 cups of water - bring to a boil. Meanwhile, peel the tamarind. Remove as much peel as possible without being too meticulous. Throw the fruit into the boiling water. Stir, stir, stir, until all the pulp dissolves. Strain the saucy pulp using a colander with big holes.  Get rid of the seeds and remaining skin, you won&#39;t need them. Or just chew on them! ðŸ˜œ"
- "Next,  we&#39;ll make the sauce. Please note, acidity in tamarind fruit may vary. For this reason, it is necessary that you adjust acidity to your liking. Brown sugar can be used for fine-tuning. Just don&#39;t make it too sweet!"
- "Pour all the ingredients in the blender. (except for the Chicken Wings, of course ðŸ˜ƒ) Switch it on and blend until smooth."
- "Taste!  Sauce should be sweet and sour. A little spicy and a little Smokey, perfect! If it&#39;s too sweet, well...  Not so good. If necessary, add brown sugar and blend little by little."
- "Preheat oven to 400Â°F Put wings in oven safe dish. Brush tamarind-chipotle sauce over wings generously."
- "Bake for 30 minutes.  Take wings out. Remove &#34;juice.&#34; Flip, brush sauce on wings. Just pour the remainder of the sauce over the wings, it won&#39;t hurt ðŸ˜ƒ."
- "Bake for an additional 15 to 30 minutes.  Check wings with fork after 15 minutes. Aim for juiciness and tenderness. TIP: the secret to perfectly glazed wings is to not move wings too much. Just let the sauce get thick and yummy on top of the wings."
- "PS: if you wish to accelerate the cooking process and increase crispiness of wings,  pan fry them first. On a medium pan, pour a little olive oil and fry wings using medium-high fire. Don&#39;t let the wings cook all the way through. Only the outside should become a little browned. Then bake as per above. This will inevitably reduce the juiciness of the Chicken."
- "Enjoy while still hot! Happy cooking ðŸ˜ƒ."

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
