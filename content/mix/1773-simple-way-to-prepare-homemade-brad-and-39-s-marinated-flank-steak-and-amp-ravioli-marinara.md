Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
