Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
