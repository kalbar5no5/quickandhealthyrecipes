Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
