Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
