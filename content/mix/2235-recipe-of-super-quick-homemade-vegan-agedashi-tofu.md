Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
