Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
