Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
