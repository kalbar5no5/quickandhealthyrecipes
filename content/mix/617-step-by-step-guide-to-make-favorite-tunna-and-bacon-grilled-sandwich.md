How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood.

Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!
