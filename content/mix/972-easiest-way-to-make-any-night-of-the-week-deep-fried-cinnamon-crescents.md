Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
