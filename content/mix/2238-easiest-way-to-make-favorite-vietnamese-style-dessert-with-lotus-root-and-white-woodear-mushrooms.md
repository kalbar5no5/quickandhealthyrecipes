Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
