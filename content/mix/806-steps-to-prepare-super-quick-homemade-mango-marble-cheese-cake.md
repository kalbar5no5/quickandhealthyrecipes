Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. In a small saucepan, combine water, butter, and chocolate; cook and stir over low heat until smooth. Anyway this makes a large cheese cake. i had to move to a bigger pan. halfway through cooking it had risen so much i thought it would overflow in oven but it did not. it went down while cooling. needed more crust though. i&#39;d make again and add in some filling. i dont like super sweet so this worked for me. Drizzle or spoon over cheesecake, and with a skewer or paring knife swirl the puree through.

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
