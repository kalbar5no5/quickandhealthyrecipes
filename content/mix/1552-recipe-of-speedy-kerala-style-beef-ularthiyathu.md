Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
