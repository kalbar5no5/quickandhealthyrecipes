Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
