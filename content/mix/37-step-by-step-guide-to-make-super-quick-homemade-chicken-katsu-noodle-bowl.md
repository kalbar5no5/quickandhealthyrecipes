Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
