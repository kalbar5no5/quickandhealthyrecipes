Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
