Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
