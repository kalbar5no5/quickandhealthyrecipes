Whether you keep it in the refrigerator for after-school munchies or serve it at your next fall party, the crowd-pleasing treat will make everyone smile! Inspired by: Spinach and Artichoke Dip I&#39;m a fan of classic dishes but frequently tweak them a bit to suit my family&#39;s tastes. My cheesy spinach dip is a little lighter than other versions I&#39;ve seen and pairs well with bagel chips. —Jenn Tidwell, Fair Oaks, California Palak pakora can be served with coriander chutney or mint chutney or tomato ketchup. I served the spinach pakoras with the mint-coriander chutney along with homemade brown bread. 

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
