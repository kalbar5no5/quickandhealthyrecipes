Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
