How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
