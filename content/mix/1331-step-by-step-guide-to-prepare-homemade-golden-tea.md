Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
