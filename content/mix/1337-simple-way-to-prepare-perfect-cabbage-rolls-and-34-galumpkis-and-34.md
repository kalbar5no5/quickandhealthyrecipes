Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
