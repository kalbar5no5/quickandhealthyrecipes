Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
