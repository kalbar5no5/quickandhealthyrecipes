Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
