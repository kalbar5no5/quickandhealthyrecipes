Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
