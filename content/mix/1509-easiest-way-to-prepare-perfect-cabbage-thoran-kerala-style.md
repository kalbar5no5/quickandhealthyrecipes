Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
