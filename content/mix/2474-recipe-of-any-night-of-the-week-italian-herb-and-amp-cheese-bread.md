Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
