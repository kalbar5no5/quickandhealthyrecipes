Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
