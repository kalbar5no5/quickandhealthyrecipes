Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
