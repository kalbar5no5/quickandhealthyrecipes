Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
