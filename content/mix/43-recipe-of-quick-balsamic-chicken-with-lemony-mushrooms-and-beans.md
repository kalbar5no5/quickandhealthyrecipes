Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
