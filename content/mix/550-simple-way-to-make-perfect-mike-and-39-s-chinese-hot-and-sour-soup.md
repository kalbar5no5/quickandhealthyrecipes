Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
