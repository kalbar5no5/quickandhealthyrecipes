Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
