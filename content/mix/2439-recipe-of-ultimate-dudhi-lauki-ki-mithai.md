Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
