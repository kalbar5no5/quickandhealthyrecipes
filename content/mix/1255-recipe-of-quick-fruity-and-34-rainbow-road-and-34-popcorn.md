recipeingredient:
- "1 small box of each color of JellO"
- " Red I chose strawberry"
- " Orange of course I did orangelol"
- " Yellow My choice was pineapple for flavor variety"
- " Green Lime obviously hehehe"
- " Blue I did blueberry"
- " Purple No brainer here too Grape"
- " Small bags of each color in vanilla Wilton CandyMelts or"
- " Large bags in red yellow and blue to mix making each color"
- " red  yellow   blue  yellow  green blue  red   etc"
- " Approx 12 c popcorn kernels popped per flavorcolor"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pop one batch of kernels at a time (saves counter space, since this will make a HUGE batch collectively, or you can just choose a flavor you&#39;re craving and make just the one flavor)"
- "After popping a batch of kernels, melt approx 2/3c. CandyMelts (according to their package directions) to match your flavor. If you are mixing primary colors (red/yellow/blue,) do 1/3c. of each of the 2 colors you&#39;re mixing, but you can melt them in the same container. Why make more dishes than necessary, right? Lol"
- "Stir melted candymelts till smooth then pour over the popcorn and gently fold it in to coat well and as evenly as possible. This may take a few minutes, but the color pay off is worth it, I promise!"
- "Little by little, sprinkle the coordinating jello flavor (in its powdery form, don&#39;t cook it! Lol) onto the candy-coated popcorn while its still melty, this will allow the powder to adhere to the popcorn, gently folding it in. I found about 1/2 package was perfect. ***And I learned the hard way, don&#39;t try to cheat by mixing it into the melted CandyMelts, it will make the candy far more difficult to distribute onto the popcorn. #EpicFail.....don&#39;t try it, trust me lol***"
- "(I also discovered, since sugar free Jell-o packages are a lot smaller, it will take the whole package)"
- "Once flavored to desired strength, spread out on a parchment paper or wax paper lined baking sheet, and chill in the fridge until the CandyMelts are set (about 10 minutes)"
- "Break apart if necessary into small pieces. If you&#39;re going for the full rainbow or even only a couple colors/flavors, dump it into a fresh, and unused (of course...) 13 gallon trash bag (and set it aside, and continue the previous steps for each color/flavor."
- "When doing the whole rainbow or just a couple flavors, after they&#39;re all in the bag, leave a big pocket of air in the bag, twist it closed tightly to keep that air in, and gently press upward with one hand and/or roll the bag on the counter to mix all the flavors evenly together for that pretty, colorful, and very flavorful appearance!!! If you&#39;re not doing the whole kit &amp; kaboodle, just break your small pieces straight into your serving bowl and enjoy!!!***"

Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
