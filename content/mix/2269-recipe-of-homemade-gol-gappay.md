Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
