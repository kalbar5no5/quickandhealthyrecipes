Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body.
