Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
