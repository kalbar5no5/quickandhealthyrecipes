Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
