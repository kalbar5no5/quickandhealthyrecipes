My recipe may seem involved, but it has proved extremely popular and it also works brilliantly in place of ordinary chicken in curries. Rice is an absolute MUST with authentic Chicken Tikka Masala! White rice is traditional but I often serve it with jeera rice, which is jasmine rice that is lightly spiced and oh so fluffy! Naan is also non-negotiable when you serve Chicken Tikka Masala!

White rice is traditional but I often serve it with jeera rice, which is jasmine rice that is lightly spiced and oh so fluffy! Naan is also non-negotiable when you serve Chicken Tikka Masala! I love to eat naan plain but it is the perfect vehicle to scoop the chicken chunks and spicy. To serve hot: After defrosting frozen Chunks until thawed (as given above), proceed to heat by choosing your preferred method below. Microwave Oven: Only use defrost mode. 

Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
