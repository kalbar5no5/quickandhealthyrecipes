Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
