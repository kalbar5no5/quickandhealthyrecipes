Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
