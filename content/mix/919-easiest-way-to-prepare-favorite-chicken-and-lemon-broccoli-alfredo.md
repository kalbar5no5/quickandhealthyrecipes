Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
