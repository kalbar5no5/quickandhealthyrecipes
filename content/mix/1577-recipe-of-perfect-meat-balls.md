Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
