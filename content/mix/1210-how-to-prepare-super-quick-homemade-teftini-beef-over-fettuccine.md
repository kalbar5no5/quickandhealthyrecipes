Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
