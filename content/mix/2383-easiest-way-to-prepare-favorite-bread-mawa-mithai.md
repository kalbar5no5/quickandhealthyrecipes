Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
