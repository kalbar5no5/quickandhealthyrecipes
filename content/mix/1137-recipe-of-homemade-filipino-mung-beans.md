Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
