Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
