Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
