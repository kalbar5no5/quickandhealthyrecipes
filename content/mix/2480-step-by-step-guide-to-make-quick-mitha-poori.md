Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
