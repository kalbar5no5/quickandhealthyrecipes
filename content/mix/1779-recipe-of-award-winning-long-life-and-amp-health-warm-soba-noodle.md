Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
