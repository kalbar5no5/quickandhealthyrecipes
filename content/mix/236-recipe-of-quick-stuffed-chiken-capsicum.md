Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
