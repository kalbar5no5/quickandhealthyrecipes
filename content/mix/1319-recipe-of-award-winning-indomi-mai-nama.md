Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
