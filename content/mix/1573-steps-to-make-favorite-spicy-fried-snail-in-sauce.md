Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
