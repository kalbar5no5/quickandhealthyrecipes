Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
