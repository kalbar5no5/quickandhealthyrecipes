Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
