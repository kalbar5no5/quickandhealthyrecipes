Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
