Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
