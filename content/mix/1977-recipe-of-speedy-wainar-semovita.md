Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
