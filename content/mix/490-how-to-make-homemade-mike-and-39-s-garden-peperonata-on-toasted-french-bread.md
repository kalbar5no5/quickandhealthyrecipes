Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
