Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
