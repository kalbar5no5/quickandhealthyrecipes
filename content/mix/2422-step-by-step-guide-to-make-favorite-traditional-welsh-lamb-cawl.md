Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
