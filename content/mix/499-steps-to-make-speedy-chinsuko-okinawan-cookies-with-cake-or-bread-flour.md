How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
