Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body.
