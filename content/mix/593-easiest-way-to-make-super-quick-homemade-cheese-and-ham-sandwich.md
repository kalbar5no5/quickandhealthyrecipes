How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
