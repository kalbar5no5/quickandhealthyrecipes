Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
