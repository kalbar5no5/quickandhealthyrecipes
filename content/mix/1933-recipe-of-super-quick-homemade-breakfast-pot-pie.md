Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
