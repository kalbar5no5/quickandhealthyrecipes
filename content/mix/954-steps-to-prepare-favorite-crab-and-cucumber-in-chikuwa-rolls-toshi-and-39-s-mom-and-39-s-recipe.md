How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
