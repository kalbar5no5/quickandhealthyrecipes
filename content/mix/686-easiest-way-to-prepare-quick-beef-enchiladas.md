Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
