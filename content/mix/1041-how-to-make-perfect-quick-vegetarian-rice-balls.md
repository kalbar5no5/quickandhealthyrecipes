Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
