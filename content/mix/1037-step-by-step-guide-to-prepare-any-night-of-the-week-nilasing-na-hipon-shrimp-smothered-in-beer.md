Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
