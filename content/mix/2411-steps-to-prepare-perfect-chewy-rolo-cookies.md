Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
