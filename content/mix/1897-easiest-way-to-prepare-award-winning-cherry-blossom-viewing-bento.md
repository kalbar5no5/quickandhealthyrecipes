Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
