Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
