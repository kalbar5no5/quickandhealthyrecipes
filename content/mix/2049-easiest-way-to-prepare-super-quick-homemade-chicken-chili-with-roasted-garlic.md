Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better.
