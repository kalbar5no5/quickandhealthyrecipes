Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
