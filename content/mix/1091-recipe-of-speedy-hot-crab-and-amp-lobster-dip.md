Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
