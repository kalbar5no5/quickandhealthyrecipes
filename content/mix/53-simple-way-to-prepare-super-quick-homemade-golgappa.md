Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
