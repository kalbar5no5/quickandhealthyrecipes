How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
