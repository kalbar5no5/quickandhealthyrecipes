In our recipe a quick and buttery pat-in-pan dough bakes to a shortbread-like texture that gives the tart a sturdy base. In a large bowl, toss apples, brown sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, vanilla, and salt together. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar.

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
