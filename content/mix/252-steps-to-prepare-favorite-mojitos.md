Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
