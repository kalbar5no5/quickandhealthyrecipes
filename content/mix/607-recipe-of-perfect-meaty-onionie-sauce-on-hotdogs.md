Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
