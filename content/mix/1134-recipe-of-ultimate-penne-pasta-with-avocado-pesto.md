Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
