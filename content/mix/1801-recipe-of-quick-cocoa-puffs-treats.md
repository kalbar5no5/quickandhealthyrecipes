Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
