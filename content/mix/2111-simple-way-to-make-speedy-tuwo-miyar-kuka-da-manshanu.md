Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
