Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
