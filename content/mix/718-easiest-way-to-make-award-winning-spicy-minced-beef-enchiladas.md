Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
