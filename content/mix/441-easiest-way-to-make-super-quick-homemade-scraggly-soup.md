Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
