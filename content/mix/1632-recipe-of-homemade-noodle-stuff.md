Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
