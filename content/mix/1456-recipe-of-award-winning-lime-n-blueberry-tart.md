Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
