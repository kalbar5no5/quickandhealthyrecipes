Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
