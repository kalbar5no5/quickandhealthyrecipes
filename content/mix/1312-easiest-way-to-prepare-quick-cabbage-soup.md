Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
