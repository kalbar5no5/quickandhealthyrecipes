Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
