Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
