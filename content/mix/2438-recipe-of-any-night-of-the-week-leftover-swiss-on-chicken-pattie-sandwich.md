Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
