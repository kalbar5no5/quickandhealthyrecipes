How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
