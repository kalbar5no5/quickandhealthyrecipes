Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
