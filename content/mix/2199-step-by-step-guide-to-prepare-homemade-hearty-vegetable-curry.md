Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
