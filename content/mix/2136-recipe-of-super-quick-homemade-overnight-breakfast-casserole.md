Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
