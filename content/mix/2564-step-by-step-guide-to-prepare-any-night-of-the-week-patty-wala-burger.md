Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
