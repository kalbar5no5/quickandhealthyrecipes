Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
