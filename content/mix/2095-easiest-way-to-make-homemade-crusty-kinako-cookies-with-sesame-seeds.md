How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
