How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
