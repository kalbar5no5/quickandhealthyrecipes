Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
