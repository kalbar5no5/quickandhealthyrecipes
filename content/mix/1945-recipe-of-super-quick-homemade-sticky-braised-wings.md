Start by cutting your pork for your Shanghai braised pork belly. Dark soy sauce along with regular soy sauce is what gives these wings their rich color (if you can&#39;t find it, use regular soy sauce). We like to use all flats-arguably the best part of the wing!—but a mix with. 

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
