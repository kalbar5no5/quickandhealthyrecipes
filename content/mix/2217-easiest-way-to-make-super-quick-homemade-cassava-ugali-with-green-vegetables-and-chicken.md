Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
