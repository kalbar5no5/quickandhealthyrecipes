How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
