Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
