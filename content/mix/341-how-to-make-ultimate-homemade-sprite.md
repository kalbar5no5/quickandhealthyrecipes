Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
