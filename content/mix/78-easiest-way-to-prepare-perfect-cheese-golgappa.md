Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
