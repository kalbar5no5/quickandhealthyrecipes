Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
