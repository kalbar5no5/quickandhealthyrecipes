Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
