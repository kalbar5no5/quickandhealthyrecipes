How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
