Hey everyone, I hope you're having an amazing day today. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a special dish, bruschetta. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I'm gonna make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

This bruschetta will turn out every time you make it. Use small slices of bread for a unique appetizer, or serve with Italian dishes. Cut the baguette into diagonal slices to allow for the most surface area possible. Bruschetta with Peppers and Gorgonzola Ina Garten tops these toasted bread rounds with sweet sauteed peppers and creamy Gorgonzola cheese.

Bruschetta is one of the most well liked of recent trending meals on earth. It's enjoyed by millions daily. It's simple, it is quick, it tastes yummy. They're nice and they look fantastic. Bruschetta is something which I have loved my whole life.


To begin with this recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can have bruschetta using 11 ingredients and 4 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Bruschetta:

1. Take  Evoo, s&amp;p
1. Prepare  Garlic, sliced

This delightful recipe was created as a way of salvaging bread that was about to go stale. The true flavor of the bruschetta is on the &#34;sauce&#34; that forms from the tomatoes&#39;juices, olive oil, and seasonings marinating together. To keep the bread from getting soggy, make sure it is well toasted, and use a slotted spoon to serve, if desired. At our house, we fight for those last juices--to sop them up with a crusty baguette is Heaven!

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
