- "2 tbsp granulated sugar"
- "2 tbsp olive oil"
- "1 cup warm water"
- "1 packages active dry yeast"
- "4 stick mozzarella string cheese sticks"
- "1/2 stick melted butter"
- "1 Garlic salt or powder to taste"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat the water to warm. Do not get it to hot or it will kill the yeast."
- "When water is warm, add the package of yeast and stir well to activate it. Let sit for 10 minutes, until foamy. That&#39;s how you know if it is active."
- "Pour the yeast mixture in the bread pan. Add flour, sugar,  oil and salt in that order."
- "Set the machine to the dough cycle. You may need to add a couple of tablespoons of water if it seems dry. Do this by spoons and only enough to moisten it from being to dry."
- "Let the dough cycle finish and let rise. After the first rise, remove from bread pan."
- "On a floured surface, knead dough until no longer sticky. Usually just a few minutes."
- "Cut the cheese sticks into 4 equal size pieces so you have 16 pieces total."
- "Pinch off golf ball size pieces of dough and place a cut piece of cheese into center and form ball around the cheese. Pinch to seal all around to hold cheese inside while baking."
- "After cheese is tightly secured inside and edges sealed, roll the ball into your hands to form a more round ball if you choose."
- "In a pan, spray non-stick cooking spray. Place each ball about a inch apart. This should make 16 balls. You can make bigger or smaller depending on your preferences."
- "Cover and let rise until doubled. About 30-50 minutes depending on how warm it is where your rising dough."
- "Preheat oven to 350°F after dough has risen to doubled in size."
- "When doubled in size, bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown."
- "While rolls are cooking, mix the melted butter and garlic together. I like adding parsley with mine, but you can also use chopped garlic to your taste also."
- "Brush butter/garlic mix over hot rolls."
- "Serve hot with pizza or spaghetti sauce if you like :)"
- "You can also make this with stand mixer with dough hook, or by hand. I have done it all 3 ways, just a lot easier in bread machine :)"

Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
