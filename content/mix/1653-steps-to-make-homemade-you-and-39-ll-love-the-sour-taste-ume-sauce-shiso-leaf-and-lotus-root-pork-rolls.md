Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
