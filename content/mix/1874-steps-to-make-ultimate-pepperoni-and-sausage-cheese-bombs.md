Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
