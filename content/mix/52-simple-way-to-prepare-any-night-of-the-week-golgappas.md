Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
