Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
