Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
