This gizzard meal was so delicious, yummy, and filled me up. I was first introduced to the glory of Southern fried chicken gizzards at Roscoe&#39;s, a chain of chicken-and-waffle houses in California. It&#39;s a place where you&#39;ll never have to worry about running out of the whipped butter that accompanies not only the waffles but just about everything else on the menu. Par-boiling the gizzards really defeated the whole purpose.

1. Heat oil in a pan / skillet
1. Clean the gizzards especially this part in picture it peels off very easy

1. Move to paper towels and repeat till done
1. Serve immediately you can make a gravy with the leftover flour and make smothered gizzards in gravy.

It&#39;s a place where you&#39;ll never have to worry about running out of the whipped butter that accompanies not only the waffles but just about everything else on the menu. Par-boiling the gizzards really defeated the whole purpose. YOu need to marinade gizzards overnight in either buttermilk, sour cream or yogurt so the toughness is broken down naturally and absorbs the tangyness of the marinade. In this Southern Fried Chicken Gizzard recipe, gizzards are marinated in a spicy bath of buttermilk and hot sauce then battered in a seasoned flour and fried to golden brown perfection!! Serve with my Collard Greens or Mustard Greens and Hot Water Cornbread for a truly Southern meal. 

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
