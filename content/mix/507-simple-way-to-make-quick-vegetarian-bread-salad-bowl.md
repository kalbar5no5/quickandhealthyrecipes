Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
