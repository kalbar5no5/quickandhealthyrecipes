Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
