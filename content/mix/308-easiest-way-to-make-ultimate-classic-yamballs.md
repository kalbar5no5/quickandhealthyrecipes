Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
