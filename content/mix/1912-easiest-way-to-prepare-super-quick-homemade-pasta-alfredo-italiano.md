Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
