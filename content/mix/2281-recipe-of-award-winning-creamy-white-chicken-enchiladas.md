Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
