Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
