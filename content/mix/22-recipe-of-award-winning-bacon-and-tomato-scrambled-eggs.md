Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
