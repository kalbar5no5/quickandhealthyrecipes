Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
