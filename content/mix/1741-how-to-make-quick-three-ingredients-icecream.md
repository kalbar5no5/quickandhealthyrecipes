Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
