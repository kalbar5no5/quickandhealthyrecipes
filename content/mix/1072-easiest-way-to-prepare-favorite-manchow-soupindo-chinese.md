Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
