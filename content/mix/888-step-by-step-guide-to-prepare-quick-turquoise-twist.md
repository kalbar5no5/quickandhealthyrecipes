How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
