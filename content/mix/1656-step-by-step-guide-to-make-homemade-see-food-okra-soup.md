Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
