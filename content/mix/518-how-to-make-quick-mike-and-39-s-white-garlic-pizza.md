Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
