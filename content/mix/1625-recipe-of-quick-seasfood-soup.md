Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
