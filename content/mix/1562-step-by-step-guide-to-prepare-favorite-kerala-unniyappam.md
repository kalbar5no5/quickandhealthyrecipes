Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
