Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
