Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
