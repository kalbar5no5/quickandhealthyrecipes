Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
