Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
