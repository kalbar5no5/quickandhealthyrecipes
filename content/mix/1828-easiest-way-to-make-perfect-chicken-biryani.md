How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
