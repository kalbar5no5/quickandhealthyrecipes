Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
