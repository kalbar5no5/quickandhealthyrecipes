Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
