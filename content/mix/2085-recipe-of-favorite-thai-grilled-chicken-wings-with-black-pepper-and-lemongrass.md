Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
