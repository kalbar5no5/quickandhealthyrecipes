I make for example a spinach salad with vinegar, water, salt, pepper, sugar and oil. But what does Beb Vuyk do with bayam (spinach)? Today we eat this crunchy stir-fried spinach dish. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
