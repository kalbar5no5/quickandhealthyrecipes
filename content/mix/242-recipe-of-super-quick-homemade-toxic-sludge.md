Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
