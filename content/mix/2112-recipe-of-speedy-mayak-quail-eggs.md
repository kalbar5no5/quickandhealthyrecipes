Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
