Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
