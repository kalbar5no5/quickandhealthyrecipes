Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
