Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
