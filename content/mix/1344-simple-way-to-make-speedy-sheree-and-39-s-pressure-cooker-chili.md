Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
