Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
