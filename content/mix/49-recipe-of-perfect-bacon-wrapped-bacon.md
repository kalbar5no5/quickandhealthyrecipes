Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine.
