Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
