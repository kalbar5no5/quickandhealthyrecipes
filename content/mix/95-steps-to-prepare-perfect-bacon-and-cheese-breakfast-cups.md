Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
