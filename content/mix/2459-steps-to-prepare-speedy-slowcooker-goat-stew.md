How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
