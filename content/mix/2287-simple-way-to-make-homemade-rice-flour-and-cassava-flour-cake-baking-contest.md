Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
