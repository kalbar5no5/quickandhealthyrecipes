Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
