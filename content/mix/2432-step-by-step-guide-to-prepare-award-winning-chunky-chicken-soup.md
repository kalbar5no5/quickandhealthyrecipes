Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
