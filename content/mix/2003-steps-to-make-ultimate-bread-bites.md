Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
