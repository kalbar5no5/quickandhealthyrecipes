Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
