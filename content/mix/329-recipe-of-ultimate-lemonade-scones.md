Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
