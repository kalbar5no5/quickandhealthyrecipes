Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
