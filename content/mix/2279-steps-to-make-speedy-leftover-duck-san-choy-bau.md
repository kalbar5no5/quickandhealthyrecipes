Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
