Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
