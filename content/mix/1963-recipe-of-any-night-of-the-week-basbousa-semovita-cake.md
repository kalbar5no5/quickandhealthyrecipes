Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
