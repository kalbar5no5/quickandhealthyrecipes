How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
