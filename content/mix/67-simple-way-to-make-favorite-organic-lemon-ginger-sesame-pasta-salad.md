Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
