Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
