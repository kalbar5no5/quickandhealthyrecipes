Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
