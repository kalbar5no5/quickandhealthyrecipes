Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
