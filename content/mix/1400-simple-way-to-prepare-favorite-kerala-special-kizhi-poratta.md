Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
