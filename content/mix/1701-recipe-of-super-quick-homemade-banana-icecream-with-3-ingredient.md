How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
