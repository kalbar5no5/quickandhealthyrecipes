Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
