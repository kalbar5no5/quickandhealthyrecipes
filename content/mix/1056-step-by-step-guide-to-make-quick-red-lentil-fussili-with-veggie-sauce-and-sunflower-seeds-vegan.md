Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
