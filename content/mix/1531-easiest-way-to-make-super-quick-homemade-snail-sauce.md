Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
