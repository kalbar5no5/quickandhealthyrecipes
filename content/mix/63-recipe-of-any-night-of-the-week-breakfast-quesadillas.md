Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
