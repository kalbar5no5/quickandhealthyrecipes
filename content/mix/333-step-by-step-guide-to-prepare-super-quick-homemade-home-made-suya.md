Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
